107hfj5,minature series,"Over 2022, I wrote about 30 little pieces for solo piano. I find it very satisfying and helpful to my process to constantly finish little things in between my larger projects- it helps me stay organized and keep composing.
Stay tuned as I'll be releasing one little miniature recording a week on youtube for the next few months!
This first installment is called ""Madrigal"" after the old italian vocal tradition. It's a tender little thing that I think is appropriate for this time of year! It's dedicated to my old composition teacher at Peabody, Michael Hersch, and is a sort of hommage to some of his music.
Hope y'all enjoy!

Are publishers companies or people? Do I need to find a person, almost like an agent, to find work for me and get my music out there? Or do I register for a company?

I have so many questions on how ASCAP works but I should leave that for another post. For now I'll just ask... what is ASCAP? I cant figure out if its just a registry for royalties or if its a way to get music published as well.",1673278386.0,Composers,8,142,33,613

Would it be possible to do so with only a classical guitar at my disposal? I know many would say just learn piano, but it’s physically impossible to fit a piano/keyboard anywhere in the room I’m renting.

I’m not sure how much they cost as well, but I’m somewhat sure I’m too broke to afford a decent one.

I’d also love to know what type of music is composed in these times, my knowledge of modern music and composers is quite limited.

Edit: To add some reasons for which I asked this question:

1 - I’ve always heard you have to know how to play piano to be able to compose, that it’s the composer’s instrument. 

I, however, learned music later in life and don’t want to have to spend so much time learning another instrument before I can start rudimentary composition. 

I would like to learn it as I go on however for sure when the time is right.

2 - I’m not interested in composing solely for guitar, but in general orchestral composition for all instruments.

I learned guitar mainly because it was convenient with a lot of web resources and how cheap it was to get into, but I’m in love with music in general, not guitar music only.

So, this is a piece I've been working on for about a year now....Not steadily, I would walk away and stew for a while from time to time lol I've had the sound down for about four months, but been working at getting the notation at least close to readable, imho. I hope you enjoy this piece and please let me know, critiques and criticisms are appreciated!

Overall themes of this piece revolve around expressing the struggle between dual natures, within ourselves, our social groups, our beliefs, and so on. This is meant as catharsis, not necessarily inspiration or instruction. This theme is emphasized with the continual use of counterpoint. I try to restrict this to left hand vs right hand throughout, but I'm a guitarist, so piano players, let me know where I'm off, but be gentle lol 

Note on difficulty: This is meant to be a DIFFICULT piece. Some sections may be easy for intermediate/advanced players, but this should not be approached as an early piece of repertoire. Piano players, I would greatly appreciate feedback on the real level of difficulty. If you learn this one, please let me know and share your vids playing this! That would be great!

MVT I - Discovery

This movement is meant to encompass the feeling of exploring and learning, academically and socially, literal journeys and adventures that we all go through emotionally, if not similar experiences.

Here, we've learned Truth, and it's hurt, bad...feel the pain!! Seriously, I love this movement. I've struggled with depression for a few years, and last summer was an especially difficult point in my life. This piece of music kept me alive. Obviously, I'm biased lol but I'm absolutely enthralled with this one, I hope you enjoy!

MVT III - Triumph

Originally titled ""Victory Through Acceptance"" but that's a little wordy and yeah, not cool lol But that's what I'm trying to express here. It's a bouncy piece that accepts the hazards of the past, resolves them into itself, and floats away, free.

105351f,The Mountain Path - Ys inspired music,"Hey fellow composers,

I've been trying to broaden my horizon since I need a wide variety of styles as a soundtrack composer and so I wrote a few pieces in the style of the Ys soundtrack.

For those who don't know: Ys is a long running game series by Nihon Falcom. Japanese Action RPGs. The music blends orchestral/classical music with metal and rock. Some are just orchestral, some are just rock/metal, some are a mix of both.

Since my attempts went so well, I decided to put together an album for Bandcamp. A mix between music inspired by the Ys series or a tribute, if you will and my own style. I already have a few pieces and this is the first one that ventures into metal territory. I've never done that for video game music, so this is a first but I'm quite satisfied with the result.

When I'm back at my workstation I can use CSS and Ministry of Rock 2 by EastWest to make it sound really good. In order to write it in Dorico, however, I had to resort to the Halion library. The guitars sound surprisingly decent but the strings are horrible.

Anyway, if you know the Ys series, tell me, if this fits the mood of the soundtrack. If you don't know it, I'm still grateful for feedback of any sorts.

Enjoy!

104p1vd,Toogle pause-note: Note input in engraving software,"Dear community!  
I have always wondered about note input methods. All the software options out there (Dorico, Musescore, Sibelius, I am excluding Finale here) have a similar approach to it. They introduce a special note input or ""write"" mode, which one has to leave with the escape key.  For me, this does not make sense in any of the programs, because I do not see the advantage to just navigating the notes with the cursor keys and making changes to pitches and rhythms. 

Also, they do not allow to input notes without knowing their pitch. As a modern composer pitch is just one parameter of many and this focus on pitch and traditional music is so disturbing these days. (as in designing a car engine and the software always asks: and what color has your car? what color? color first!... it is so childish :)  


This is the reason I installed an old Sibelius version again, where you can toggle a rest to a note and  just write in peace... and fast! (it is especially Dorico to ask for so much user input, that a fast and hustle-free note input mode is prohibited).

Is there any software that would allow me to play the midi part without specifying a tempo, then after it is done go back and tap a key where each beat so the software could then create the notation for me.  I remember doing something similar with Finale long ago, but it required me to have a metronome going and then playing to the clicks.  I want to play for the action in the video which means the beats will be varying throughout the music, which is why I need to be able to go back and lay in the beats.

Recently I've been giving a hand at composing for other types of ensemble, like Full Orchestras, and Concert band. I started out from not know what an Oboe was, to having a general idea on what each instrument does.  But when I attempt on working on one, it's like I burn out midway. Run out of ideas on how to develop further, like I ran out of composition juice or something for that individual piece. 

I'm starting to think that I'm simply just not ready to advance to that sort of level yet. Or is it just a mindset thing with composing stamina? Should I just stick to writing solos and such until I feel like  composing string orchestra is as easy as drawing stickman? (Obvious exaggeration, but you get the point)

1021xki,Aamulla varhain (Early in the Morning),"Hello all,

I have recently made an arrangement of the lovely Finnish folk song, Aamulla varhain for SATB choir: https://youtu.be/-mqECnNE5cg

Please, have a listen and provide any feedback you want. There are probably mistakes somewhere, and it’s always nice to have a second pair of eyes (ears?)


The lyrics in Finnish are:

Aamulla varhain kun aurinko nousi, 
Kun minä unestani heräsin.
Sydämeni oli niin surusta raskas, 
Miksi sä kultani hyljäsit mun.
Sydämeni oli niin surusta raskas, 
Miksi sä kultani hyljäsit mun

En minä tahtonut uskoa lainkaan
Noihin silmisi sinisiin.
Mutta kun tie oli ollut niin pitkä, 
Monista murheista lupauksiin.
Mutta kun tie oli ollut niin pitkä, 
Monista murheista lupauksiin.

Yö oli kaunis ia äänesi hellä
Kaiken nähdä sai uudestaan.
Riemuiten annoin ma sieluini sulle, 
Miksi sitä et huolinnutkaan.
Riemuiten annoin mä sieluini sulle, 
Miksi sita et huolinnutkaan

Miksi sä hyljäsit toisen tähden, 
Miksi mun uneni loppua sai.
Sydämeni on nyt surusta raskas,
Kun sinä kultani hyljäsit mun.
Sydämeni on nyt surusta raskas,
Kun sinä kultani hyljasit mun.


Translated into English (very) roughly:

Early in the morning when the sun rose, 
When I woke up from my dream. 
My heart was so heavy with sorrow, 
Why did you abandon me, my darling? 
My heart was so heavy with sorrow, 
Why did you abandon me, my darling? 

I didn't want to believe at all 
To those blue eyes of yours. 
But when the road had been so long, 
From many sorrows to promises. 
But when the road had been so long,
From many sorrows to promises. 

The night was beautiful and your voice was tender 
You could see everything again. 
Joyfully I gave my soul to you, 
Why didn't you worry about that. 
Joyfully I gave my soul to you, 
Why didn't you worry about that? 

Why did you forsake another star, 
Why did my sleep end? 
My heart is now heavy with sorrow, 
When you, my darling, abandoned me. 
My heart is now heavy with sorrow, 
When you, my darling, abandoned me.

(It's just the musescore export for now, I don't want to mock it up for real until I'm sure the composition is done.)  


This is a character theme for the creator goddess in my in-development indie game. The OST version here is in basic ABA form, but in game it will simply loop ABAB as long as it needs to. The A section is a compound period melody with a very homophonic texture, but the B section has more interest and movement between voices. Not quite polyphonic but I'm not sure what you'd actually call it.  


I wanted a sort of classical sacred music feel to reflect the nature of the character as a holy figure. The cadences are definitely very classical but the harmony leading up to it is not so much I think. Also I don't think the voice-leading is very classical, it's too smooth and not interesting or intricate enough (mostly similar and oblique motion, too little contrary). I do like the sound of it as it is, though - does it still need some adjustment or is it working as it is?  


Thanks so much for your time!

Firstly, there were a lot of string specific sounds like the continuous harmonic glissandos that were hard to find suitable analogs for within the winds. The repeated asynchronous passages were not too hard to notate, but were very hard to get to sound good in the audio rendering without sounding too robotic.

I'd appreciate some feedback so that I can have some more things to work towards this year.

Full disclosure the Piano audio is a MIDI because I wrote half the piece by playing it on the piano and the other half was completely written by score and I didn't have the time to practically re-learn my own piece. But I plan to get to it later on.

It's a great way to learn, especially from those who have more experience than me. I'm working on a major project. Without giving too much away about what it is, I had the idea to use click tracks help with three points: logistics, sonic thickness, and consistency. 

The orchestra is going to be what I consider very large, so I'm looking to use click tracks to save space on stage if it ever gets performed live, God willing; including having space for a full SATB choir, with six vocal soloists at the front of the stage.

The second part is that some of the instruments, which while not uncommon as such, might not be available to all orchestras who may wish to perform the project, which is some 35 songs in length. This is where the consistency angle comes into play.

As for the sonic thickness part, I'm using six different synthesizers which need to be included in the click tracks regardless.

With all of this figured in, do you have any input yea or nay about click track usage for such a large project, or for a project in general? I hope that I didn't ramble too badly when writing this.

From an orchestration perspective I can’t think of any reason he would’ve done this, since they’re not playing immediately before this chord either and there’s a few measures of rest between this and their entrance. My only guess is maybe because it’s marked fortissimo and bassoons aren’t that loud he just said fuck it they don’t need to play? I have no idea.",1672454023.0,Composers,14,112,84,564

I haven't written any new music in a while due to stressing over college applications, practicing audition music, and revamping my portfolio. I wrote this quartet in \~3 hours, so some things may be a bit rough but honestly I was just bored and wrote this for fun.

Any feedback would be appreciated! Not sure what to do with this piece, but I think it sounds pretty cool. I've never written for clarinet quartet before and wanted to explore how the ensemble works. I also wanted to try writing something with tempo changes within the piece and creating musical/non-awkward transitions in between them, which I'm not used to doing.

If anyone has any title suggestions, please share them! I'm a bit uncreative in that aspect of composing.

I have reached my goal thanks to all of you with getting one thousand people to respond to this poll. This is the final reminder to give any who have not yet participated to let us know their favorite composers in the unique order they wish to submit them. As I have access to the each list, I can say with certainty that there are no duplicate lists, every single submission has been different!

This may not be an easy task so be sure to take the time to properly format your response as well as follow the rules of the submission process. So far only 8 submissions have been removed for various reasons (numerous repeats in lists, spamming the keyboard, including Squidward Tentacles, not meeting the required minimum number of submissions (5), &c. 

By my rough count, almost 1500 composers have been mentioned, which is more than the number of people who have participated, so the likelyhood you will add a composer to the 1500 is high. Any composer is welcome no matter how obscure, you never know if you may be the first one to include that composer and get their name recognized.

Results will take a few weeks to compile, as there are a few different charts and ways of counting the data that I have entertained to take on. 

This has been a truly rewarding project and I hope to continue my polling on Reddit about that different and numerous dimensions of this fantastic artform, and while those future projects may lack the volume of this one, the enthusiasm that I see in my DMs means quite a lot.

[Score (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TTQP35EvpP8jtK6vrtBKCZt-b6daQt3C/view)

The title of the work is derived from the artistic statement of Belgian artist Dmitri Likissas:

*""I consider each colored dot to be like a person. You and me and everyone. Together we all make up that image shown. You will notice that in my work all the dots are spread out evenly in a grid. The grid stands for me as for rigour and rules of society. I could have easily made squares instead of dots, but squares are not free, squares can not roll, but dots are free and can roll. Personally, I don’t want needless rules, I want freedom. However, some basic rules are needed, exemplified with this grid, which shows that together even though we are free (dot can roll), we can create an image if we follow basic rules. So creating these works besides being tedious, I am constantly fighting the rules to be met (the grid) because without the grid, I don’t get the image. From close by, dot by dot, it doesn’t tell you much, however from a distance, the colored dots blend together and makes you see something totally different. So, together, with some rules, we create a wonderful world. I also aim for the people that see the work to be amazed that at first glance they didn’t see an image. That they have to pay just a little more attention to the basics.""*",1672412465.0,Composers,21,304,92,1405

I hope you are doing well and had a lovely Christmas/holiday. 

I just wanted to share the latest single release from my upcoming album ‘This Too Shall Pass’. The album is a musical journey through my experiences of living with bipolar, including a suicide attempt and subsequent electro-convulsive therapy to recover. 

This track is the second on the album, and was written after I made an attempt on my life and ended up in hospital - I was trying to capture the feeling of despair and loss of hope that comes with severe depression. The album will hopefully be fully released next month, and $50 of all album (and single) profits will be donated to mental health charities focusing on crisis support. 

 I hope you enjoy the piece (as strange as that feels to say).

I'm in a bit of a hurry to write a couple of compositions, and came up with this theme.

It's a folder with built-in plastic sleeves that has a nice, thin profile that's perfect for the score I printed (it didn't make sense to have a thick three-ring binder to hold just 17 pages when they would fit perfectly in something no thicker than a half inch from cover to cover).

Unfortunately, I was unable to find anything similar for holding legal size paper (8.5 x 14).  So far, all I've found are three-ring binders with a minimum of 1 inch diameter (which I suppose will work if necessary, they just won't fit in my instrument cases quite as well).

zxm99x,"What makes a ""good"" theme and variations?","There's all kinds of ""Music Theory I""-level discussion online about the form from a bird's eye view, but I've noticed nothing at all about the craft of the form, about what distinguishes a good T&V piece from an amateur or ""schoolwork"" one, or even a bad one.

I assume that being too literally repetitive is one way to make a bad theme and variations, as is only having a couple variations. A Mozart-style construction where each variation is self-contained and played with a pause between each is probably also not exactly a refined technique today.

zxlgw4,Icescape - landscape piece for orchestra,"This is a piece I wrote to depict the feeling of standing alone in an icy field at night. I live in a relatively sparcely populated area, and it can get quite cold here in the winter. The second half of the piece, after the short episode in the strings, is almost identical to the first half, but it feels lighter in character due to all the minor chords being turned major and vice versa. This was also the first piece I've written using MuseScore 4 and the new sounds are pretty good! They've definitely helped my music feel more ""real"".  


The piece is nominally in D major, but it very quickly modulates to D minor and then is further altered from there, until the string episode occurs and we end up back in D major, which is where the piece ends. Also, I've been listening to a lot of Bruckner lately, and there are traces of that influence in parts of this piece, I think.  


Thank y'all for listening! If you have any feedback I'd greatly appreciate it as it really helps me improve!

So basically, I've been working on an Orchestral piece lately and recently I've been thinking that since it's in the Sonata form how about me making it the first movement of a Symphony and then follow it with other movements.
I'm pretty happy with my melodies, the harmony, instrumentation and etc. Problem is, I chose 78 BPM for the tempo which is nowhere near anything anyone would consider ""Allegro"". And even if I double the length of the notes and double the tempo, it'll be ""Presto"" or at least ""Vivace"" which still won't work.

Just some background: I have taken lessons a few times over the years, but I never stuck with it longer than a few months.  I also abandoned music production due to work for quite a number of years, but now I'm able to devote some time to it, so here I am.

So, is there any program suited for this scenario (meaning I'm not interested in learning specific pieces but how to compose, play chords in different keys, transpose, try to an what's in my head, etc.)?

A little fugue on ""Happy Birthday"" (a tune which is now in the public domain) in F, for Recorder, Oboe, Clarinet, Basson, Orphicleide. Tuning is an extension of the diatonic Passion scale (7537573) in 37edo (based on F).
The extension is got in the following way: first, the diatonic Passion scale is constructed, and its tones are named F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E, then it's extended to 12 tones by adding B, F#, C#, G#, Eb at a distance of +3\37 from Bb, F, C, G, D.
This gives the following scale:
C	-	0\37	-	0
C#	-	3\37	-	97,2972973
D	-	5\37	-	162,1621622

Hello fellow composers,

&#x200B;

Here's my track Beautiful World made using synths, a grand piano, an orchestra, a choir and organic textures (all sampled instrument).  I'd really love to get your feedback on all aspect (composition, orchestration, mixing).

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot!",1671920156.0,Composers,7,83,42,556
zuhzn9,Dynamics,"I understand that some composers select different dynamics for different sections or specific instruments of the orchestra due to wanting a specific timbre, wanting something to be more in the background than foreground, wanting something to be more prominent or less prominent, or wanting something to be more restrained/forceful

The question I always go back to is “How do they know?” If the orchestra will balance itself what’s the point in doing different dynamics for each section? Wouldn’t you want everything to be heard equally?

I understand that one shouldn’t treat dynamics as if they’re a volume fader, but it’s hard not to in certain circumstances such as in a choir w/ orchestra arrangement. I don’t know if I’m overthinking here, but I used to mark the orchestra one dynamic below the piano and the choir because I wanted the piano and choir to be more prominent but I’ve learned recently that this isn’t good since the orchestra will balance itself. I also used to mark the brass one dynamic level below the strings. Again, I was probably overthinking.

I know that having everything at say forte could possibly make the orchestration lose a sense of “what’s important” but again wouldn’t the orchestra balance itself so that everything could be heard equally?",1671913529.0,Composers,1,252,8,1277

Recently, I started a series of compositions written only with sines waves sound (maybe you have seen my previous ones on this subreddit).

I hope you will like it!

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. Just about 800 people have responded with over _one thousand_ unique composers in their rankings! Given this fact, it is likely you will add a composer to the roster of those already mentioned. If you have a composer you feel deserves more recognition, this is the place to put them for all to see! You never know if you may be the first to mention them. I have wanted one thousand participants for the project since it began and we are about ⅘ to that milestone! 

To clarify for those who haven’t come across this poll yet, this is _not_ to rank which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : the instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked well. (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) Four submissions have been removed for submitting spam and or improperly formatted votes. _Please no P. D. Q. Bachs or Squidward Tentacles._ Given that the list is analyzed as a single entity, such submissions disqualify the entire list. The link above describes this process in more detail.

Share this around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect more reminders throughout this last month as the poll begins to close down and responses recorded. Upvote if this is something you’d like more petiole to see. Coming up will be the Four Month Update, One Week Remaining Reminder, and Two days Remaining reminder. Poll Ends December 31st at 11:59 CST.

Justice incited my sublime creator

So far I can tell that DM Dokuro was inspired by OLD VIDEO GAME music and PROG ROCK... Some techniques he might be using are SECONDARY DOMINANTS, BACKDOOR \[ii V's\], TRITONE SUBSTITUTION and MODAL MODULATION. These are tutorials with similar themes and sounds by Gavin Leeper

2. Are there any other theory techniques that I'm missing out?
3. Are there any other people (preferably Youtubers with tutorials or sheet music) that have a similar sound?

I always try to put much effort into listening to your feedback and go on to implement it in the next piece as good as I can while still staying original and true to myself and my inspirations.

As recommended, I cleaned out my sheet this time by hiding some dynamics stuff that is only for playback and I tried to put more attention to individual voices and to build a real motif for recognizable characteristics, especially on the left hand - instead of only playing chords and arpeggios up and down.

The sad style is intended though, pretty new vibe for me to write in, it was great fun! I also animated some rain and saturation changes on the video just for fun but.. well, that has nothing to do with this sub.. :)

zo5ug5,"I wrote a winter-themed choir piece with text by the scottish poet Robert Burns - ""Up In The Morning Early""","# Program Notes

*Robert Burns* supposedly wrote the poem *Up In The Morning Early* as a statement of his dislike for the Scottish winter mornings back in the seventeen-hundreds. I wrote the piece for my local youth choir, and imagined that this frustration Burns penned so long ago was something that would resonate well with the members of the choir today.

In addition to Burns' words, the music is inspired by British carols and modern nordic choir music. The words have been preserved in their original Scottish language, and so this is a true mixture of Norwegian and Scottish culture and influences.

Is it possible for me to become a composer?,"My main concern with possibly becoming a composer is that listening to score music is such a big part of my life already, how could I come up with unique music without drawing on the massive library of music I’ve already listened to? 

Obviously I wouldn’t intentionally copy a piece from Brian Tyler, but how can I not unintentionally incorporate elements from music I’ve already heard? With such a large volume of music that I listen to daily, and how important that music is to me, how could I hope to create unique music when the music I love plays in my head all the time? 

I’ve created one or two action pieces in my head over the course of my life. I don’t know anything about music, don’t know how to write music, but these pieces weren’t derivative at all. The catch is that I was wasted when I “composed” these tracks. 

But it did reveal an appetite to compose music. I could see my love of score to be an advantage, but I think the downside is apparent.

I'll write down my particular idealized workflow below and it would be awesome if y'all could help me find the best way to realize it, or a least approximate it. TL/DR at the very end of the post.

**ONE:** I'd usually start with some sort of free classical improvisation (mostly using my MIDI keyboard with VSTs, sometimes live instruments). In most cases, I'd play without a fixed tempo, even coming to an occasional halt when I need a moment to think ahead. While I'm improvising with the keyboard, it'd be helpful to see a ""unrhythmized"" notation of the last 30 or so note pitches/chords I'd been playing.Then I'd often record a second or even a third track, improvising over the first improvisation.

**TWO:** In the next step, I would listen to the result, repeatedly, marking parts where something interesting had happened. Ideally, I can now directly look at those parts in the shape of a grand staff notation and quickly separate the left hand from the right hand, and also unite the three different tracks into one piano reduction, perhaps showing the different tracks as differently coloured note-heads.Since I'm playing so off-tempo, the note values would of course be ridiculous, so I would need one of two options: Some kind of AI that manages to approximate a sensible score OR the possibility to ""punch in"" the musical metre afterwards (by playing it back and repeatedly pressing a key where the accents fall).

**THREE:**  In my dream software I could now press a button that loads all of the selected sections as multicoloured piano reductions (with the same VST configuration as before) tied together with possible audio recordings, into a new project page, and there I can now edit the notation, splice parts together, transfer voices into separate tracks/staffs, and develop the parts through more traditional composition methods. I don't need great engraving capabilities, but compositional tools like transposition and retrograde, and some common ornaments would be great. The goal is not a perfect mock-up or a publishable engraving, but a finished composition.

That's the heart of what I've been doing in the last few years, mostly between Studio One and Notion and pen & paper. But it always remained a cumbersome operation that surely could be much easier. Apparently, the newest Studio One has its own score editor now, which might make the procedure more straightforward. But maybe there's something else entirely out there that would be perfect for my process? Does anybody here have an idea?

Thank you kindly!

**TL/DR:** Need software where I can jam freely, turn the jams into a piano reduction quickly, and then work with those piano reductions conveniently.

zmsz1y,Practicing Orchestration Analysis,"Hello!  


I have always learned to compose music by interpreting what my favorite composers do. Since I enjoy more film and video game music than anything else, it is often the case that my favorite pieces do not have scores available to study. This leaves me to listen to the composition and use my own ear to isolate each part of the orchestra and determine what's happening in the music.  


I'd say I do a decent job of analyzing music in this way, but not as effectively as I'd like. I can understand the harmony pretty well. With orchestration, I can figure out where the melody is being played and often know which instruments are doubling it. 

I can hear accompaniment elements, but this is where I have to start inferring  harmony from the bass notes as it becomes difficult for me to pick out exactly what the accompaniment is doing or what is playing it. I might be able to hear some brass chords, but I might not be able to tell if it's just French Horns, Trombones, or both together - I might be able to tell what the top note of the chord is being played by the brass, but I must infer what the inner notes of the chord are by listening to the bass. I might be able to hear a rhythmic string pattern, but not be able to tell if it's the second violins or violas playing it, or if perhaps the clarinets are helping them.  


Are there any good techniques to get better at clearly hearing what every part of the orchestra is playing? I know this often depends on the quality of the orchestration, but this is a general issue I seem to have.",1671130692.0,Composers,3,320,33,1554

zm2kqq,Is it unprofessional to inquire about potential gigs through current team members?,"Howdy!

For context, I landed my first game audio composition + sound design gig this past summer after years of grinding and casting nets. I love the team, I love the concept, and it's been awesome so far and crystalized the idea that this is more or less the main path for what I want my career to be. That said, I've been juggling it with two day jobs from Monday to Friday (~40hrs/wk), essentially putting in a ton of work on the game on weekends. And even though I truly respect and appreciate the people I work with, it's just not sustainable and it's driving me kinda crazy, especially now that I've achieved a tangible taste of my dream. I don't have nearly enough time to practice my instruments or have a semblance of balance in my life due to effectively working 7 days a week.

I know it might have to be like this for a short amount of time, but I'd like to transition to full time music as soon as possible, so that leads me to the question:

Is it unprofessional to ask the devs/artists on our team if they know of any other projects looking for audio peeps? It's a very small team (>10 people), we all get along super well, and they genuinely love what I've done so far and give really great feedback (especially when a draft for something doesn't QUITE fit) but I don't want to overstep the boundaries of our relatively short relationship. I feel this is the foundation for my career, and the start of something really cool with my team, but I wanted to get some sound advice from other composers before goin' straight to asking.

Thanks for everything y'all! This community has been immensely helpful already, and I can't thank you enough.",1671052864.0,Composers,13,350,82,1657
zm0s8d,Title suggestions for a movement in Sonata-Allegro Form,"In a multi-movement work, you can name an individual movement ""Scherzo"", ""Minuet"", ""Sarabande"", ""Chaconne"", ""Rondo"" etc to emphasize that this movement has a particular kind of form. If the overall work is titled ""Sonata"", ""Concerto"" etc the first movement ""Allegro"" tends to be in sonata-allegro form. 

Consider a very non-traditional piece structure. Suppose you're writing a multi-movement piece named not after a form. (Suppose you name your piece something like ""Exotic Birds"" or something like that). And you want to title a movement (doesn't have to be the first one) such that its sonata-allegro form is emphasized. What would you title this movement then? It could be ""Sonata"" but that feels way too non-idiomatic because sonatas are multi-movement pieces, it feels confusing. Could be ""Allegro"" but that doesn't seem obvious enough (because the title ""Allegro"" could also only be referring to the tempo), besides you may be writing in slow or very slow tempo. E.g. you may have a very slow 3rd movement that is in sonata-allegro form, and you may want to title it something like ""Sonata"".

zlqp52,"Wind quintet, first draft for feedback","I'm going to park this until January so seems as good a time as any to get some feedback, if anyone wants to give it a listen.

It started with the idea of 'chromatic chorale', and each movement has a varying balance of those two things. The melodic material and most of the harmony are based on a melody that I think only appears fully formed in the dirge at the end, but there should be threads of it running throughout.

The first movement is intentionally more vanilla than the others, but I don't know whether that means it's not as interesting or needs a bit more to keep people's attention over the 4-5 minutes. Section C still needs some work as I can't find the right balance of playfulness without falling too far into jazz.

The second movement needs some more work overall and the third is mainly sketches of ideas at this point.

Happy for any feedback. :)

Thankfully, I didn't go through with it and I've picked myself up day by day, week by week and I've been doing much better. The only problem is that now, for the sake of my writing, I need to get back to that ""hopeless"" and ""no light at the end of the tunnel"" mindset so I can write truthfully for this second half of the movement. Has anyone else ever had this problem? That they needed to be in a mindset to capture the emotion but they can't get themselves back there? Or is this more of a question for actors and how they get into a character and stuff like that? Thank you!

&#x200B;

My specific question is if bars 6 to the beginning of 8 are correct.

The progression, in A minor, is moving from E minor 1st inversion down at the beginning of m6 down to a french sixth (dominant 7 flat five in jazz-speak) with an f in the bass. This french sixth harmony is, in my mind, maintained from bar 6.5 through to bar 7, finally resolving at the beginning of bar 8.

Other notes in this range are non-harmonic.

zj4e9c,Three Weeks Remaining and 8400 votes submitted on the Large Scale Google Poll — Who are you Favorite Composers?,"There are more than 8400 votes on the [Large Scale Google Composer Poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxXI2Ag4ai2bm1ATguas2WdDCag2MZesGONVT4O8ttqBqiHg/viewform) now. The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 729 people have responded with over _one thousand_ unique composers in their rankings! Given this fact, it is likely you will add a composer to the roster of those already mentioned. If you have a composer you feel deserves more recognition, this is the place to put them for all to see! You never know if you may be the first to mention them.

To clarify for those who haven’t come across this poll, this is _not_ to rank which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : the instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) 

There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect several more reminders throughout this last month as the poll begins to close down and responses recorded. Poll Ends December 31st

zilyft,If You Can't Replicate Your Instruments Should You Still Compose?,"Let me start off by saying I have composed zero pieces, and I'm an extreme novice when it comes to music. I've dabbled in Fruity Loops with free vsts and I have a Yamaha keyboard but I don't know how to play it except through muscle memory. That said, I have songs in my head. I know what instruments are used, but I don't know what notes are playing. Meaning, I can hear the notes, but it would take time for me to find them on a keyboard as I have no idea what note I am hearing off the bat notation wise. 

Example, I hear trumpets. I hear the notes and how long they hold their notes for, but I don't know if it is a B or a C etc... Until I hit the key. Eventually I learn the muscle memory to use these keys. My biggest issue tho, is that I can't replicate certain techniques using software that I know a real person would be able to.

Example. A violin does three of the same notes quickly as it flows into other notes. Or, a violin slides from one note to another. The free software i have can't do this. (As far as I'm aware, at least). 

Eventually though, I memorize the keys for a section, like the solo violin as the strings in the background are playing, but then comes my biggest issue... The sound. The Instruments I have sound NOTHING like the ones in my head. Sure sometimes I'll get a few that are amazing, but then others I'll get some that can't replicate the sounds I am after. So then I feel like the piece, if I WAS to make it, would sound terrible UNLESS I had those instruments. 

With all these factors: the sound of the instruments, the technique of the instruments, and not knowing what notes my instruments are played in off the top of my head (I can hum the notes but again, no clue what they are notation wise) should I just NOT compose until I actually have the instruments I need? Or should I just use crappy instruments for a first draft, and then later IF I get a way to use different instruments, just remake it with said instruments? 

I'm on the fence because I feel like if I make something, it has to be a quality I can stand behind, and if it isn't up to my standards, then I'm doing a disservice. But again, I just want to know if that's a negative way to think about things. Thanks for your time and hope you have an awesome day =)",1670750649.0,Composers,12,514,65,2274

For me I feel like I associate different feelings or moods with different keys, so I’m wondering how people who might not have this association make decisions about key. For example, if I want something to feel “dark” (in either major or minor) I might use A-flat/G-sharp since I feel like that’s the darkest key, whereas if I want something to feel light I’d probably tend towards with a key with fewer accidentals.

I think for me I often (but not always) use whatever key I came up with the thing in, but I think I actually write differently in different keys so I think that might not be the same. In general if I followed this all the time I think I would be worried about stuff like using white-key keys too often, or only writing pentatonically with black keys, for example.",1670641210.0,Composers,18,187,96,890

1-I just randomly add instruments, hoping that they will sound find all together.

2-Notes from the piano often do not directly translate into i.e. a bassline, or xylophone, or a synthetic arpeggiator.

3-I feel I am quite limited in using a sequencer (in my case logic X), and this may affect my workflow and my focus on the actual music writing.

I will have a new release coming out soon and am looking to get some reviews to help generate buzz in a targeted community. Can anyone suggest review sites that might be interested in an unknown composer?

This release is entirely instrumental and intended for indie film makers, trailer houses, game dev's and others who are interested in instrumental, highly atmospheric music but with a definite pulse.

21 tracks - most of them around 2:30 minutes duration, some around 4:30. Influences include Death Beats(genre), Doom (M. Gordon's OST), Halflife, Cyberpunk 2077, Future Sound of London, the overall impression of films like Blade Runner & Blade Runner 2049 and maybe director Terry Gilliam ala Brazil.

Futuristic but with distorted/disturbed contemporary elements.

Sounds/instrumentation includes synths, altered acoustic instruments, heavily manipulated noise/found sound, pitched and percussive orchestral, pianos and some altered voice.

Regardless of the software, proofreading is important. Assuming that you're satisfied with the text as the program understands it and all your voices and instruments are in their proper ranges, these are some things that I think need to be checked before trying to publish a score:

* The names of voices and instruments are spelled correctly and specified clearly.
* Every entering voice or instrument has a dynamics marking (including one of a pair of instruments on the same staff)
* Notes that can be close together aren't too close together
* Accidentals don't clash with notes, articulations or other score elements
* Courtesy accidentals are provided for all next measure cancellations (so the musician isn't left wondering if the composer forgot to specify)
* Rehearsal letters or other kinds of signposts for rehearsal are plentifully provided

zg0pb2,Pentatonik - my first composition,"I'm 14 years old and have been playing the piano for 6 years now. Recently I got interested in composing piano pieces. Since I already had some music theory classes I decided to write this piece. Pentatonik uses the pentatonic scale, meaning it's played solely with the black keys. It conveys a melancholic feeling and is beginner friendly. I have linked the piece on sheetmusicdirect down below. Please respect the copyright and buy the piece if you are interested in it.

zf8ase,"Thoughts on sharing audio file with musicians, and letting them play one layer at a time","For context, I just finished a string quartet and trying get it played by a professional artist. However, when I contacted artists online, I was often asked to provide an audio sample from the notation software.

I had mixed feelings about this. On one hand it's trivial as I already have this audio file. However, I'm inclined not to share it because I want the input to the artist to be just the sheet music. I'm most interested in seeing the notation creating music. Moreover, I do not want the artist to be influenced by the terrible computer render. I use MuseScore and I absolutely *love* it, but it doesn't create realistic audio like NotePerformer etc so it sounds extremely robotic and awkward. There are some very emotional parts in this string quartet, and I want the artist to interpret them themselves, as indicated by the notation.

When I asked artists why they're asking for audio, some of them said this is for synchronization. They said that they'll record one instrument at a time and then merge them. I was surprised by this. My string quartet has very fast, challenging and rubato parts, how can they realistically do this without coordinating with cues? Are these essentially ""soft"" scams, in the sense that they're truly good professional artists but they go into this job knowing it's not going to be as good as 4 musicians playing together? This convinces me even more not to share the audio file as I don't want to help people doing this.

Thoughts on this? Am I overreacting? This work means *so much* to me, I spent the entire 2022 working on it. I don't want to cheap out; I want to find a good artist who can do this well. Any thought is welcome.",1670435936.0,Composers,17,349,88,1676
zf2kty,Updating my resource!,"Hey all!

Posted in here a while ago about my new music anthology and just wanted to give some updates :)

I got some scores from big names in the game!  Mark Applebaum, Marti Epstein, Lara Poe, and many others have contributed their scores!  There are now musical examples with recording links on the site!

My goal is to get a piece for every technique so all sounds can be represented.  Every day I'm adding a little more.

I also got some super niche instruments that I think the community would enjoy.  Yesterday I recorded the Lujon (used by George Crumb), Bar Chimes, and Bell Plates.  They are all relatively ""simple"" instruments in terms of construction, but there are insanely cool spectralist-esque techniques you can use with the overtone series and acoustic setting manipulation.

I'm still open to some of you composers helping out on the project, so if you have new music and would like it posted in the anthology, send me a DM or leave a comment!  Your work will be alongside faculty from Stanford, Berklee, UCSD, and many others to come :)

[This article](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/30/1139707179/where-did-all-the-key-changes-go?utm_source=pocket-newtab) says:

>While the key change was once a mark of musical sophistication, many now  consider it a crutch. Dalla Riva says a lot of his peers think using  the key change is lazy.

but then goes on to describe the key where you jump up a half-step or a whole-step. I do not think that key changes are crutch if they are well crafted. As usual, these type of articles are speaking out key changes as used in pop music and through out a blanket statement like, ""using the key change is lazy.""

I think there is some truth in what they are saying, that now artist are focusing on using rhythm and texture over the notes and chord progressions. But I believe this is actually a result of lack of music education. IMO, they are doing this, not because they want to be original, but it's what sells. Rhythm and texture is the easiest for the untrained listeners to understand. The average listener wouldn't appreciate an interesting chord progression or melody were to hit them on the nose.

The sounds are actually pretty good, no idea how well it responds to articulations etc because I've never really listened to it that way, and vibrato is a bit ropey, but it's usually pretty listenable, far better than any native MIDI file playback I've heard on a computer, and can give you a different perspective on your writing if not necessarily ever going to make a polished final product.

Quick aside: I am a first-year music student in college, and most of my musical knowledge is from years of picking up tricks from random internet blogs and YouTube videos. Please forgive me if I have made any notation errors in the score.

&#x200B;

Like always, things started off really well. About a week ago, I had a spark of inspiration after class and just started writing stuff down. The idea didn't come from a laborious session of thinking out what the whole piece would look like. I just sort of heard my brain fire off what I can only describe as a completed cross-section of a larger piece, and I quickly wrote it down before it escaped me. That initial idea was the first four bars in the PDF. 

The chords and the flute melody came from similar inspirations, just following what sounded good in my head. I was in a flow state for this part, so if there was any consideration for music theory at this stage either I don't remember it or it was completely subconscious. I did sit down at a piano at one point to figure out the voicing for the marimba arpeggio over the new chords. 

However, it was at this point that I started to bump into an issue that I know all too well. I tried to avoid it, instead spending time writing an oboe harmony to extend the piece just a little bit further, but alas, it was only a matter of time before I had to face an enemy that has followed me since the beginning: the B section.

My weakness as a composer is that after I've gushed out the first 30 to 60 seconds of a piece in a fit of passion, I have absolutely no clue where to go from there. I'll spend days writing tons of melodies and chord progressions that sound good on their own, but when it comes time to slot them in after the initial idea the result invariably feels jarring and unnatural. 

This has plagued me for the entire time I've been writing music, especially when it comes to chord progressions. I'm completely torn on why this is, not to mention what the hell I'm supposed to do about it. One of my professors told me that my harmonic language will develop as I progress through the music theory course, another told me that I need to expand my repertoire for my declared instrument to get a ""broader musical perspective"", and another told me to just listen to music similar to what you're writing (which isn't helpful when I don't know the first thing about distinguishing different styles).

All this to say, given what I've written, how should I approach writing a B section, and what do you usually do when you get stuck like this?",1670179064.0,Composers,10,617,58,3025

zbkgy5,"Not being able to finish music, stops me from sitting down to write in the first place...","Hi All,

I have now made music for about 2-3 years, I have written pieces I am proud of, I have also written some that I did not share with the world, but I always try to make a conscious effort to not let perfectionism get in the way of sharing my music with the world and tell myself ""It's good enough, just release it!"".

Now, I have unfortunately noticed that I find it very hard to sit down and actually start writing some new music regularly... I have managed to find the culprit of this and narrowed it down to a simple but important factor in the process; and that is to come up with an idea and them turn it into a full piece of music that is more than just 1 minute long.

I write orchestral and hybrid video game music, and I keep hearing my favourite composers spit out 4-5 minutes of music like it's nothing - A part of me wants to be able to do this, but I sometimes find it extremely hard to get past the 2 minute mark, due to not knowing where to take the music and its different sections, I have noticed this is actively stopping me from sitting down in my free time to make more music, because I know that I will eventually get stuck mid writing a new piece, and not know what the next section should be in the cue, and eventually just close my DAW in frustration and call it a day...

I come up with a nice idea and manage to develop it, and on a good day everything just flows and it's great, but on most days I get to 1 minute of music and I feel like *""Okay, so I guess this is where the song ends, because I have no idea what should come next...""*. It is very frustrating and takes away the enjoyment of wanting to write in the first place... I also have a slight desire to some day try to do music professionally, but I keep questioning whether I eventually will have the patience and workflow to get things delivered on a deadline...

&#x200B;

For proper context, I want to include some facts about my music and my workflow, that hopefully provides a bit of a better understanding of how I make music:

\- *As mentioned above, I write video game music; mostly in the fantasy and sci-fi genre (Big percussion, epic horns and strings, choirs, as well as quiet and atmospheric ambient pieces)*

*- I am greatly inspired by the music in video games such as the* ***Elder Scrolls*** *franchise,* ***World of Warcraft*** *and other titles that fit role playing action and adventure.*

*- I come up with an idea and use it as a motif/foundation and try to develop a whole piece out of it, it can some times be a melody or rhythmic pattern on strings, it works but at some point I get stuck, after 2-3 sections...*

*- My DAW of choice is Logic Pro, and I use Audio Imperia's* ***Nucleus*** *and* ***Chorus*** *for orchestral sample libraries.*

*- Often I listen to music in a very analytical manner, I really pay attention to what is happening and take mental notice of how it's structured. But even after being able to understand the music very well and how it was composed, I still struggle to put it into practice in my own compositions...*

*- I have tried to watch lots of videos on music composition and how to turn an idea into a finished piece of music, but I don't really seem to be able take that information/tips and actually use it...*

*- I have noticed that if I write something that I really like myself, I probably end up listening to it over and over again, instead of getting on with finishing the whole song. I have heard that this can have a very bad impact on your creativity?*

&#x200B;

Do you guys have some wisdom when it comes to this kind of problem, or any ideas how to overcome this frustration of mine that is keeping me from doing something that I love doing, but without it being tiresome?

The film tells the story of a teenage girl who dreams of becoming a professional demolition derby driver. The story follows her journey of training to win the state demolition derby championships with the help of her friends, all while keeping this facet of her life a secret from her father. The films most prominent themes are persevering until you succeed, overcoming your fears, and understanding the value of friendship. 

The film is 75 minutes long, and while the movie wouldn’t be wall to wall score, most scenes will have music. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, or if you have any questions about this project, please direct message me with your portfolio website and contact email.

za7c6d,Who Are The Great Lyricists of the Twentieth Century?," have a hypothesis based on opinion (which means it's not a hypothesis) that the great songs of the Great Rock Songbook (my term ) are more lyric driven in their construction than songs from The Great American Songbook. Like him or not, Dylan is among the most influential songwriters ever. His lyrics earned him a Nobel prize for literature. That is not nothing. Obviously, what stands out about his songs are his lyrics that lend themselves to interpretations by other musicians. The covers take on whole new melodic shapes from the originals.( I still don't know how many roads a man must walk down. Is it seven?)
So who else of this era is among your favorite lyricists?
As far as TGAS, the ethos was much different. Most of the great songwriters had separate lyricists. My personal favorite is Cole Porter, who wrote both great melodies and great lyrics. He had a knack for being risque’ without crossing the line of the standards of the era. I also love the way he would force rhymes. (If you can’t be a ham and do Hamlet, they won’t give a damn or a damlet.) The premise of this song is great: learning Shakespeare will get you laid.
Of course, we must exclude the rap/hip-hop era because often lyrics have a much priority over melody and harmony. So please share your favorites and why.",1669945481.0,Composers,10,270,53,1294

z9prop,What composers inspired Grieg?," Hi,

So a while back I posted on here wondering which composers have been inspired by Grieg, but now I have the opposite question.

I am wondering if someone could give me some clear info on if they know any classical composers that have inspired grieg in some of his work. After doing some online googling I've heard vague and different opinions like people saying Grieg hasn't been inspired by anyhow, and people saying f.e. Debussy inspired Grieg greatly.

And even if people said a certain composer has inspired grieg, they often don't come with examples of the similarities.

So my question is, are there any pieces by Grieg in which you can see he clearly was inspired to some extend by another composer (and in which piece of said composer can I clearly hear similarities, and/or with explanation a music-theory similarity which isn't necessarily heard but does exist if you look at f.e. chord progressions). Help with this would be greatly appreciated since I'm not amazing at catching these similarities (let alone knowing which pieces to study to find these similarities).

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 675 people have responded with over _nine hundred_ unique composers in their rankings! Given this fact, it is likely you will add a composer to the roster of nearly a thousand already mentioned. If you have a composer you feel deserves more recognition, this is the place to put them for all to see! You never know if you may be the first to mention them.

To clarify for those who haven’t come across this poll, this is _not_ to rank which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : the instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) 

There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect several more reminders throughout this last month as the poll begins to close down and responses recorded. Poll Ends December 31st

And in some of the games it even has a prominent role, being incorporated into the gameplay and as part of a cohesive narrative.

This is the reason why i wanted to see how it is made and the cultural and game design influences that go into it. This is why I was happy to learn that the actual music from the games made during the Nintendo 64 era (and even beyond!) lives inside the games' ROM files and code. After playing around a with some tools, I managed to get the original music files used. Everything is there, from the instruments used to the instructions on how they should be played, and the note sequences. Now we can get almost perfect reproductions of the music as standard music files. Thus, i decided to do a throughout analysis of the music and get as in-depth as possible into how it is made and what went into the compositions and sound design.

For the moment, i just finished the analysis of the two games of the Nintendo 64 era; with the resources, it was easy to make music visualization videos where you can see the exact notes played and all the instrument that go into each of the tracks. you can also check out additional media that helps to point out some aspects of the music. Here is a full playlist with each entry and the analysis; my wish is also to get more contributions and comments about each piece in order to get a complete understanding of the music, along with your thoughts on the tracks: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVv3ELJlNuw&list=PLETz1iOEUzpfCNJZNECrGiCR-2HJKXy_p)

I hope this will be great to gain more appreciation for the music and a valuable resource for musicians and audio enthusiasts. An extensive investigation went into the music and I’m sure you will find lots of interesting info, specially of you are interested in media composition and how, with limited resources, the composers of the era managed to create the music in older system.

I also want to continue with the project and perhaps start incorporating different games and consoles in order to create video game music encyclopedia that can become a good reference for music enthusiasts. so if you have other soundtracks where you would like a similar treatment please let me know.

The original intention was to do the project in an even more interactive way, something where you can click on the particular set of instruments you want to hear at a time, but I have not found anything out there that can do that.

I've been a musician (rock guitar, classical guitar, some cello, some bass, some lute) for a good while and have a decent understanding of music theory (good with voice leading, understanding chords/keys, etc). My musical tastes are really eclectic, everything from Early Music to Folk to Contemporary 'Classical' and a ton of things in between.  


But what I'd like to be doing is actual composition, either in traditional 'Classical' pieces, or possibly some scorewriting. When it gets to that point, I always run into some trouble. My compositions tend to end up mainly root position Major/Minor with predictable cadences, and any attempt I make to expand beyond that becomes either bland sounding, or painfully dissonant, and not in a fun serialist way.  


Does anyone have a good composition course that they'd recommend? Something that will at least give a few starting points on how to make my music more interesting to hear? I'm okay with having to work out any points of theory that I'm not great with, but the 'beginner learn to compose' classes seem to be a money-grab, and aimed at a more basic level than I'm currently at in regards to theory etc. If anyone has suggestions (youtube, paid courses, whatever), I'd be really grateful.",1669734569.0,Composers,5,260,29,1288

""Finale in Eb"" was named as such because this piece will likely be the last one I ever play in high school (I'm 17 and I'll be graduating in late May), and I think it's special that the last thing I play will be something \*I\* composed. It has sentimental value and I tried my best to capture the feeling of accomplishment, even triumph (as in, ""I'm finally getting the h3ll out of high school"").

I plan to go to college for composition, and though I have plenty of areas to improve in, I'm really satisfied with my work.

It's a method that generally makes the creative process somewhat easier, especially helpful when I'm under time pressure to write something, but more recently I've been finding it also extremely limiting in a way; with so much decided before the music has really started to be written, I think it might be limiting my creative output by locking me in a box, so to speak.

z3h84u,"How to score ""messy"" glissando","We've all heard this effect in loads of different places, but how would one go about scoring it using traditional notation for a string section? The idea is that each individual instrument (not just in sections) plays a version of gliss that are all different, so as to achieve an atonal ""mess"" of rising pitch.  


The only ways I can imagine scoring glissandi would result in the orchesta playing very tonally, with a clear beginning and end note, and that's what the effect seems to completely avoid.  


So I guess it boils down to: Is there an accepted method of scoring ""everyone play this (gliss but with the same general idea) independently of each other""?   


This example is still a bit too ""musical"" in that it ends with everyone in the same place tonally, but it's the best link I could find in a hurry: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7BHEcXNduU&ab\_channel=SoundsRecorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7BHEcXNduU&ab_channel=SoundsRecorded)",1669288096.0,Composers,7,187,30,960

I am very excited to announce that there are more than 6500 votes on the [Large Scale Google Composer Poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxXI2Ag4ai2bm1ATguas2WdDCag2MZesGONVT4O8ttqBqiHg/viewform) now. The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 575 people have responded with over _nine hundred_ unique composers in their rankings. The average voter submits a list about 12 composers long. 

I am wanting 1000 participants by New Years 2023 (or whichever comes first.) I am over _halfway_ there thanks to all of you! Trends are no doubt starting to appear as more responses come in.

To clarify, this is _not_ a poll for ranking which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : The instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) 

There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect several more reminders throughout this last month as well as a reminder in ten days for the 100 day update with a chart of the interactions with the poll thus far.

So the title is ""conflict"" but these are two folk who like each other, they're just having a disagreement about buying expensive and breakable things. 

I'm specifically trying for a '30s-'40s feel, like a buddy song. This is a long form, more or less AA'BCAA'', and for the full scene will probably be repeated in full twice (getting more varied and complex as it goes). This is a first cut at material that would be expanded on, sliced and diced with spoken word and elaborated more once I get the lyrics from my lyricist and we work out the exact plot of the scene. 

Know the RH needs some arranging, just plain half notes for max clarity in hearing the harmony for now. 

I'm not quite sold on the chords in 18-21. 

Any thoughts on being idiomatic, handling the duets, etc much appreciated. 

Piano only accompaniment,  bass clarinet modeling the baritenor, oboe modeling the mezzo, this is all specified by the assignment;. Using Dorico.

z0exlf,Question about creating cues in parts for individual instruments,"Hi all, I’m brand new to this sub, and the first thing I’m doing is posting something. I just finished a wind septet, and I’m working on the parts right now. I’ve had trouble finding information about how frequently to use cues, what degree of detail they should have, and how they should be expressed. I’m using Notion6 software, which allows for smaller notes to indicate cues. 

In general, I’m placing cues after either a large multi-measure rest area, or if the meter is tricky enough to obscure the count leading to the next entry of a particular instrument. As far as the cues themselves, I’m generally choosing whatever instrument seems to be prominent right before entry, as in if the clarinet is prominent I place a few notes of the clarinet line before the bassoon enters. I feel like I may be in overkill area, though, placing them where there’s even a small chance of one losing their place. Also, I’m not sure if I should indicate register or even identify the instrument. Specifically, if it’s clear that a clarinet is proceeding a bassoon entry, do I need to indicate that it’s clarinet, and do I need to indicate it’s register (with an 8va or 15ma, etc., whichever the case may be.) The difficulty level of the work is advanced intermediate/advanced. For that reason, it may be that someone who can play it is good enough that they wouldn’t need the large number of cues I’m placing in.

On Monday, I went to a recital hosted by a university near my residence, in which the performer was a world-renowned double bassist. There was a ""meet the performer, in the flesh!!!"" thing at the end of the recital, and when I got to him, I had with me my laptop and a collection of pieces for solo double bass I had written about a year and a half ago, hoping that I could just show him a little bit of my work. By the end of that interaction, he ended up asking me for that collection of pieces (which is probably the composition highlight of the last six months - it'd be for the year if it were not for me finishing my first symphony in April), saying ""I'm always looking for new repertoire,"" and he invited me to email him more of my bass works. 

So, what's the advice? 

When you attend recitals, especially for instruments that not every five-year-old knows about, and chamber ensembles, take physical copies of your music for said instrument or ensembles with you. Even if you don't get to talk directly to the performer (particularly for solo recitals), those recitals tend to be big reunions for people that play that particular instrument, which means a large number of people you can get to at least look at the music you wrote, and they think about you when they need to commission work.

It's just 16 measures yet, but I hope I could continue. I promised to myself to write at least a bit every day. But also I would like to invite worldwide composers-redditors to join in completing this theme, if this piece will touch somebody's soul and he (or she) will have a feeling how the music should be developed.

I created a score here: [https://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/795d1900d42141fff1dccd47af1dc796e1001e95](https://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/795d1900d42141fff1dccd47af1dc796e1001e95)

and opened it for editing. I really hope you will like this tiny piece, and maybe participate in its creation. And if we finish it, hopefully some day it could be performed by orchestra, then my dream will come true.

The playback isn't going to capture 100% of everything I want. I use only the sounds that come with Finale, so I don't currently have access to patches for col legno strings, string harmonics, or stopped horns, all three of which I use in this piece. But they aren't really *that* important, as they occur only in a few places.

The piece is in scherzo-trio form, with two distinct theme groups and keys in the scherzo, making it almost akin to a sonata, except the development has been replaced with the trio. I deliberately made the trio seem quite unrelated and disjoint from the preceding material at the start; it is the task of the transition out of the trio and back into the scherzo to effectively meld the two sections together.",1668669759.0,Composers,6,222,37,1162

Surely more classicistic than classical because of my usual eclectic elements. Otherwise not much to say about this. Just a bit of absolute music in a relatively simple ABACABA form, with the last A being a big loud coda where a simple motif brags about how epic it can sound, so don't miss this part. And of course pedal notation is cum grano salis, before anyone comes complaining.

I hope this is playable, but as long as I can play something in half the tempo I assume an actual pianist can play it properly. Well, my computer didn't complain at least.

ywwaly,"MuseScore 4 beta, MuseSounds, and a string quartet demonstration","Has anyone else checked out the recent betas of MuseScore 4? The VST integration makes it a huge leap over MuseScore 3, plus a few nice engraving tweaks and a lot of quality of life improvements (eg inserting 'pizz', 'arco', 'sul pont', etc, automatically switches the instrument without having to do anything manually; rit and accel actually do something so you don't need to insert four non-printing tempo changes every bar). Muse Group (the for-profit company that owns [musescore.com](https://musescore.com), not to be confused with [musescore.org](https://musescore.org)) also released beta versions of 'MuseSounds', a bunch of virtual instrument packs that are a huge improvement over the nasty old default MuseScore soundfonts.

Oh, did I mention they're free? It's still early days but they are approaching the quality of professional virtual instruments. So far I've been playing around with the solo strings and they are extremely nice for free software. It's only a beta version, but it includes things you'd expect in an expensive product like high quality round-robin samples, separate samples for different dynamics, legato transitions, col legno, sul tasto, sul pont, and harmonics.

There are a few quirks with it. The dynamics need some ironing out. For instance you can write ff and it will usually play ff, but if there's a pp coming up it will automatically introduce a diminuendo. Which is very annoying - if I wanted a dim I'd write a dim. There is some weirdness going on with the way it ""intelligently"" decides whether to treat a legato or slurred interval as needing a portamento effect. Which can sound quite beautiful and naturalistic in some contexts, but completely out of place in others, and there isn't any way to manually turn it on or off. But again, this is a beta of MuseScore 4 and an \*early\* beta of MuseSounds and there is a pretty large community of people working on it. For free.

Anyway, this is all pretty amazing and the people at Dorico and Noteperformer should be a bit nervous about the whole thing. The software itself seems pretty stable - I have only had one crash and I've been using it a couple of hours a day for a few weeks. And it's not like MuseScore 3.6 never crashes.

Here's a WIP piece for string quartet I uploaded to demo the sounds (score video, I know the rules): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g9Ohh3Van4&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g9Ohh3Van4&t=3s)

ywgo7d,Adjusting CC velocity levels for dynamics in Finale,"I am helping a friend create decent quality mp3s of his score that he created in Finale by importing his MIDI files into Logic and using my BBCSO Pro instruments to play it. The first hurdle we encountered was that the dynamics wrote the CC information to MIDI volume. I figured out how to have that CC information export to modulation instead, which is the CC that BBCSO uses for dynamics. The problem now is that Finale's dynamics markings have set velocity parameters (some number between 0 and 127 to dictate p, mp, mf, f, as well as crescendos, accents, etc) that are a little different than BBCSO's. Perhaps Finale is leaving room for ppp, and maybe that's 0-10. But for BBCSO, that's an adequate p. Finale's p might be 30-50, but for BBCSO that sounds like mp. And mp sounds like mf, etc etc, you get the idea. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone know how to set dynamics in Finale to output certain midi CC numbers? Say, set p to be 10, and f to be 90, or something like this? I'm looking for a quick change like this that doesn't involve my friend having to go through his score and adjust all dynamics to be extreme and that doesn't involve me having to manually adjust all the CC information.

Whenever I try to play chords, all the notes never seem to start at the same time.

I have turned off ""mono true legato"", so I'm not playing in mono either, all the notes are ringing, but they are just not starting at the same time. If I set a really long attack time, this obscures the flaw, but that's not a solution I'm willing to live with.

The music is pretty wild because unlike other composing and songwriting projects I've embarked on, I didn't impose any limits or parameters on myself when writing these pieces and I'm really proud of how they turned out.

I called the very first piece I wrote for the album ""Yellow Rose"", and there's a nice story behind it which I've written in the description of the live video I've included via link below. I enlisted my incredibly fierce drummer friend, Ben DeUrso to play this piece with me as a duo for a live performance we got to do at Rocky Mountain National Park this Autumn, and we've just released the video and audio everywhere we could think of a few days ago (streaming, etc.).

I'm not terrific at marketing because I pour so much energy into composing and crafting, and I think a lot of the people here that might read this will probably relate. I would really appreciate some views and listens and comments and I'd love to see more of your stuff on here too!

I have transcribed the piano music into formal sheet music, and I'm hoping Ben will notate their drum parts as well one day in the future.

---

I thought it would be fun to make videos of composition livestreams and I finally had the time to edit *part of* a livestream where I wrote [""Sonata Vanile""](https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/xdlktq/wrote_a_sonataallegro_movement_in_a_conservative/) (posted here two months ago). This sort of thing seems like it could be compelling if done right so I'm testing the waters to see anyone finds it interesting... It took me quite a while to edit this down so depending on the response I'll either keep going or bail entirely :)

This video is longer than I'd like it to be, so my expectations for people watching it are pretty low - **that being said, criticism would be fantastic :)**

This is still an unknown land for me, and I'm wondering about things like:

- Is this an interesting format, or, is there an audience for this?
- How is the recording setup?
- Is the content itself (the piece written, the process) interesting?
- Am I even *talented enough* to do something like this?

And here's the score to the finished piece (edited after the livestream, but basically the same!):

yso2qp,Something I realized way too late...,"I'm going to say something that might offend some, but I feel it is important to do so...and I'm curious to see if anyone has a take. I've been composing music for all of my life (since I was nine years old). I majored in music, studied all of the theory, took composition classes and lessons...the whole nine yards. Instrumentally, I started out as a drum set player, then began learning any instrument I was interested in (Guitar and Piano mostly).

In my composition classes and even in high school, it was always emphasized that if it didn't exist in notation, then it wasn't ""real"" or ""serious"". Band directors would even cut off jam sessions me and the percussionist would take part in throughout middle school and high school.

I've composed many things throughout college and notated everything. Even when I wrote for bands, I would write out all of the parts, even by hand sometimes back when I didn't have a computer. (I'm old) I've written for orchestra, string quartet, and all kinds of percussion ensembles. Some were good lol

Lately though I've been taking different approaches. I realized that most of the musicians I look up to past and present did not rely on notation. Punk bands, rock bands, some jazz bands, electronic musicians all just made music.

I started taking this approach more and started letting the musicians in my band make their own parts.  There would be a written outline sometimes, sometimes lead sheet, and sometimes nothing at all. I found out that my music became freer sounding. I found out that sometimes the notation part of composing was holding back the entire song.  Even when I wrote more personal piano music, I began playing the music itself and coming up with it entirely before notating it...then I would produce it. Finally, I removed the notation step all together...since I don't really see anyone but myself and my band performing my own music.

I came to the conclusion that notating was a means for recording music in its day. If I wanted to give someone a song before recording was accessible, notating all the details of the music on paper was a good start. From there, they can play it for themselves and discover its sound without seeing it performed live. I still think notation is good for that reason.

I realized that I was a bit stubborn in my old ways. I often repeated what was told to me many times. ""If it's not notated, it isn't real music"".  I used to subscribe to that mentality, but now I don't. I listen to more music now than I ever have.

I come here and look at the number one rule of posting music and wonder if notation supreme mentality runs through here. I no longer believe notating and composing are the one in the same.

ysbyam,Question Regarding Composition Schools,"####Hey!

I'm studying composition in Sweden and I'm applying for an exchange student program for a semester next Autumn.

There are a few alternatives, but I'm mainly considering three schools, and I was hoping someone here had experience and/or knowledge of these and could give me some insight!

---

**Cork, Ireland**

I'm mostly considering this one because of the environment and language. I've wanted to live in an English speaking country for quite a while, both because I want to improve my English speaking ability, and also since it feels more comfortable to live in a country where I know the language well. I also find the cheerful traditional folk music of Ireland exciting and inspiring, however I don't typically write in that style.

-

**Bucharest, Romania**

Looking at my interests within music, I feel like this might be the most relevant option. Great modern composers like Ligeti, Xenakis and (in a sense) Bartók all come from Romania, which intrigues me, and I'd like to know how that has impacted the education there. I don't know much about Romania as a country, but I've heard it has a beautiful countryside. 

-

**Ljubljana, Slovenia**

I don't really have any information about Slovenia or the school, but since it's a south eastern/central European country, my guess is that the music has an aesthetic that I'd find interesting. A bonus reason to go here is the location. I'd be a bus ride away from visiting Zagreb - Croatia, Venedig - Italy, and Graz - Austria. Perhaps I wouldn't have time for these trips, but having the option feels exciting!

-

---

**Who am I?**

*Just some brief info about me as a composer.*

I have a hard time defining myself and my music, I take inspiration from here and there. Most prominently I'd say that I write with influences from jazz but in a classical method and format. I also focus *a lot* on rhythm. Odd time signatures and polyrhythms and such are what drive my musical motivation the most. My biggest source of inspiration overall is Armenian jazz pianist Tigran Hamasyan, both his rhythmic complexity as well as the middle-eastern tonality is just so incredible. 

That said, I'm still very curious of essentially all kinds of music and am sure I'll learn a lot where ever I end up.

ys62u4,Symphobia etc to Notation,"Hi All,

I'm not a film composer so have never used something like Symphobia before but it looks like a fun way to sketch/outline ideas, or at least is something I'm tempted to play around with and who doesn't need more playfulness.

Being someone who notates everything though, I think I'd find it frustrating not to have a way to end up with notation without transcribing everything by ear afterwards, which would be much more tedious than just writing the music down to begin with. That said, some of the more 'aleotoric' sounds are quite cool and I'd love to see how they were notated as well.

Which brings me to my question, there doesn't exist something like Symphobia where you can quickly orchestrate ideas, but at the end you can spit out midi for everything being heard? (For import into notation software).

I doubt it, but seems like it would be really cool if something like that did exist - so, does it?

I have a lot more I could say about leading up to composing this piece and the process of it. Instead, I'll leave it out to you, most who I assume are not very familiar with more obscure Balkan music styles, to hear it for yourself- and I would love to hear your feedback and questions. 

On the notation- it most definitely does not contain everything you hear in the piece. I see notation more as a structural tool for organization of a piece rather than a prescription of what to play. 

Improvisation is big, as heard in the ney solo/taksim/mane in the beginning and certain ornamentation techniques that are typical of each instrument, discussed beforehand to form the style.

This piece is the first part of an upcoming series. I've always been intrigued by Macedonian Orthodox chant, hearing it often in my Macedonian household as my father painted icons. During prepping my capstone project while at the ethnomusicology department at UCLA, I worked with many regions and types of Balkan music styles- and eventually I noticed parallel qualities of the first echo (glas) to makam huseyni in the Ottoman (and now Turkish) makam tradition- this is why some may notice similarities in the modality and phrasing. This really interested me, also due to the religious associations of these modal systems and their almost unspoken relationship as they developed in parallel, either in the Orthodox Church chanting or Islamic recitation, or even their imprints on the folk, traditional, and classical musics. Anyways, this piece itself is an original take, and attempt, to bring in these ancient sounds and ideas onto the stage in a slightly new way. The use of the ney makes sense to me because of its old roots interweaving with many traditions over long periods of time. Similar with the ud and kanuns. The clarinet just happens to blend well with this instrumentation and I play it.",1667932673.0,Composers,30,398,170,2226
ypt308,Publishing on ArrangeMe/SMP: collections or individual compositions?,"I've had a collection of new organ music (5 pieces) completed for about a year and a half now. I've been submitting it to various publishers, so far without any luck. So I've decided to finally just go ahead and put it on Sheet Music Plus via the ArrangeMe service. So my question is, should I publish each piece individually so that buyers can buy whichever they want? Or publish it as a single collection (as is my intention if I can find a traditional publisher)? My instinct is to sell it as one collection, but on a digital service I'm wondering if I'll have better luck selling them individually than asking people to pay me 15-30 bucks for the full collection. For composers on here who have used this service, what has been your experience either way?

ypesq4,What piano song is this?,"I thought to post here because this seems like a community where people are familiar with lots of music, but feel free to delete if this is not allowed.

The song goes like this:
F4 E4 G4 C5 D5 E5 D5 C5,
G4 A4 C5 C5 A4 G4.
F4 E4 G4 C5 D5 E5 D5 C5,
G4 A4 D5 D5 E5 D5.

Those are just the notes, of course, but I think it has a melody that would be easily recognizable by playing the notes to anyone who is familiar with it. I hope I'm right.

It has been stuck in my head for months, and no one I've asked seems to recognize it. I thought it might be a ragtime piece, like Scott Joplin, perhaps, since my mom played ragtime on the piano a lot. I remember this being in an energetic style.

yp2low,Serenade for Oboe and Piano + Update,"It has been a while since I have posted anything on Reddit, mostly because I have been locked out of my account, but during that brief hibernation of mine, I underwent many changes and experienced many invigorating bursts of personal development, and I have composed nothing but this serenade (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19-YFBXOJs26D6oAVw3WqVcQens2QYiz8 ) which I believe is a hallmark in my compositional output; for almost four years I have been writing notes on a page, but this is the first piece of music that I have ever written! Of course I do not mean that so literally, as my Romance for Strings is also an equal, if not greater, contendor, however it has been almost a year and I have not made progress past the sixteenth bar, as its subject matter is deeply personal and I've yet to deduce its compexities.

The serenade is currently being rehearesed and will premiere on the 15th of November as a part of a showcase with a few other composers.

yoputm,Sonata Form: How Big is Too Big,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am currently working on my 2nd symphony and had an idea to have the piece in only two movements. The first movement being in sonata form (AB ABC AB), as most first movements are. 

But in this case, I wanted each section of the form (A, B, C) to be comprised of their own sonata form. That means A will be AB AB C AB; B will be AB AB C AB; C will be AB AB C AB

I'll add each of these sections together to create a massive 1st movement. As far as I can read online (with limited searching), this doesn't seem to have been done before.

I have just finished my first A section and am at 13 minutes. If I continue, I'm expecting each section to be the same, totaling around 85 minutes by the end of the first movement. 

Should this be done? Is it practical to be done? Has it been done before?

yo821s,Looking for Composers for an audiobook project,"I've been working to put together an audiobook of a RWBY rewrite that I've been writing. Progress is going smoothly as far as voice acting goes.

>Fighting the Grimm. Defending against the Grimm. Training to defeat the Grimm. Huntsmen and Huntresses are symbols of Remnant’s eternal struggle for peace and tranquility. Both against the Creatures of Grimm, and each other. Does it matter, though? If your town was meant to be destroyed; if your defenses were meant to fail; if your loved ones were meant to die? If there is such a thing as fate, and all your actions can do nothing to prevent pain and suffering that had been set in stone, is there a point in even trying?  
>  
>Like all those aspiring to be Huntsmen, Ruby Rose is no stranger to loss and heartache. She, though, rejects the idea of fate, and the notion that her attempts to save lives are all futile, all due to the whims of some unknown cosmic force. Her foremost wish is to forge a future made by the people of Remnant, wholly in their own control, no matter what it would cost to make it a reality.

Has anyone written a big exciting climax first and then broken it down to provide hints of themes and motifs for the start of the piece? Or come up with something that turned out to be a middle and had variations/transformations of that material bolted onto the front and back of it?

yngeli,The Wagner Dilemna,"This topic  has been  developed from another post about classical vocal music. 

Richard Wagner was one of the most creative and innovative composers of all time. Pure genius. But he was an awful human being. Not just awful. Many great artists have had strange and amoral personal lives. But he was a man who breathed hatred. His antisemetism was burned into not only much of his operas but onto the fabric of German society. He wrote books declaring his bigotry, such as ""Judaism In Music"".  The villians in some of his operas were ancient stereotypes that lacked subtlety. Many people would say to just to seperate the man from his music. But  when one of the greatest  cultural icons of Europe was also one the greatest propagators of hate speech, it's not so easy to just to brush it  aside. Wagner was Hitler's favorite composer and had VIP seats every year at Bayreuth.  He knew Wagner's family very well.  I know of first hand accounts of prisoners forced into death camp orchestras who played Wagner while the victims were herded into the gas chambers.

   But Leonard Bernstein, a man who was passionate about his Judaism, has  several recordings of Wagner's works. Daniel Baremboim, as a guest conductor for the Israel Symphony, proposed in 1991 to perform excerpts from ""Tristan and Isolde"" and  'The Flying Dutchman"".  Baremboim knew exactly what he was stirring up. If you have two Jews in a room, you will have three opinions. After a vote, the orchestra chose to perform the works after a 50 year ban on the composer.

   I realize while writing this that  it is more of a ""me issue"". So I wonder what are the thoughts of  opera and just music lovers out there. How do you approach this ground braking composer's music? I'd like to start a discussion.",1667708311.0,Composers,3,352,18,1766

ymqxf4,How or how much to abridge longer texts for vocal works,"Real talk. 

I'm a relatively experienced composer and write mostly choral works, but this is one problem I've come up against again and again. 

How do you or any other composer you know of choose where and how much to abridge texts for vocal works? 

In my mind the most verses one piece should have to be appropriate to set is maybe 5(?) which sadly excludes a huge amount of romantic poetry. 
This is shown to be fairly standard by the observation that even hymns with 6-12 repeated verses only sing through a select 2-5 verses (unless a procession is required).

I have linked 2 poems below, both of which I am considering, one is The Cloud by Shelley and it is a modest example, I think I could use about half of each of the verses given for the work I want to make and likely it would carry some of the original essence of the poetry.

The next example is from Spring, from The Seasons by James Thomson, which is a HUGE work especially if you'd like to include a section for each season and tie it all into one (longer) piece, as I would like to.

I don't see much advice on this that helps other than ""select an appropriate text"" like no shit, but when the words I have already seen and want to use are part of a MUCH larger work what should I do? In terms of naming the piece I would feel odd calling it 'The Seasons after James Thomson' but equally I cannot claim it to be my own work. 

I guess the outcome I'm seeking is:
A. A valid and genuine expression of the text that does not betray the original work.
B. A short enough work to set for choir or for soloist.
C. The strongest parts of a work represented and sung and perhaps repeated, so that audiences don't have to follow along with a page-long program for each work in order to get the important bits.

Recently I devote myself and my time for the study in a music university. The contents what I am learning is so far so good. I also learn music theory, and computer music, like music which is produced by MAX MSP.


But I do not know why, but for a few months it has become for me harder and harder to compose any kind of music.

I wrote two solo-piano works, 8-9 pages for each of them(so nearly 20 pages altogether), since I had finished the last composition. But I discarded both of them. They are literally suck. Actually I feel that my works are so suck that they are all wortheless.

So I have decided to start from the very basic point again. With very simple harmony, very simple structure, very simple figuration to compose a small solo piece. But I am not sure whether it is good solution or not.

Question : any of you does have the same or at least similar experience? If so, what was your breakthrough?









And second question is a little bit irrelevant from the first one but this issue is also bothering me now : my goal is to become a film composer. I especially love the works of Howard Shore and japanese anime/film composer like Joe Hisaishi, Yoko Kanno.

But what I mainly learn in my music university, is computer music, like MAX MSP or Super Collider. They are interesting and I am recently quite enjoying learning Pure Data. Bit this is not exactly what I tried to learn, in my opinion. You might ask a question like ""then why did you apply to that school""?

Of course we have film music lectures, but not so many. Just two. Quite smaller than what I have expected. 

Therefore I am thinking now what might be the best choice for me: (1) to take double major in Music Theory, by which I can deepen my skills and knowledges on classical music, and that will be good for understanding and digesting and producing the music like Howard Shore or Joe Hisaishi. (2) Or to transfer to another music university which has actual film-scoring department.


PS : I study in Germany. And in Germany, one learns in Music Theory major not only theory but 'style-copy' of classical composers. In Composition major of German music universities one can learn composition but only contemporary music. I do listen contemporary music but not all of them. Minimalism is very interesting for me, but all the minimalists have moved to USA, in my opinion.





So, thank you for reading my post. And how do you think about these matters? How can I overcome my compositoon-crisis and what kind of additional education should I seek?",1667589994.0,Composers,10,545,38,2655

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Fm10whccto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fm10whccto)

After the intro, there is a sustained pedal point , with a few brief changes, in the first 26 bars of the verse just before the chorus where it releases  with harmonic  movement ( (""Rhythm changes""\_). After the chorus,  tension is built in the C section  with a 26 bar G pedal point where Zawinul is riffing on the synth bass .Tension is then released by the chromatic descending bass line when Shorter goes to town on his soprano. (The song is also interesting in the way that Zawinul plays some of the bass lines on synth while Jaco swithes from the bass register then  uses harmonics  in the treble  register.) Repeat the intro, build tension with the verse, release again with the chorus and fade.

SInce then, I've found other good examples of tension and release. Any big band shout chorus fits the category. Again, Jaco Pastorious. ' ""Liberty City"" uses both a shout chorus and a pedal point to create tension and release.

In rock, two songs come to mind: Steely Dan's ""The Royal Scam"" and Hall and Oates ""I Can't Go For That"" come to mind.

So i wanted to ask do film composers really work on multiple projects at same time.

Just to brief my question:-  Im talking about a Film Composer who writes Background Score, even does arrangement amd music production and in some projects even do Sound Design like Foley/SFX for the film.

About myself:-

I hv got training from a film school where i completed graduation in the year 2020. Then 2 years went bad bcoz of lockdown. I almost thought of leaving this career multiple times but now i recently worked on a Indian OTT Film which when releases i will put the name here!

So with my experience it was good to finally be able to make living out of music career and it was fun composing and producing for film!

So it took me almost 1 month for background scoring and another month for SFX/sound designing this 100min feature film. Yes it is very much like a upcoming Bollywood OTT film.
I usually do both scoring and sfx for a 20 min reel of film in 2-3 days.

So if i take a webseries then a typical episode of 22-24 min will take me around 2-3 days. Amd 10 episodes will take around 20-25 days.

Now the director wants me take 3-4 such webseries projects. Hence it would mean doing bgm and sfx for 30-40 episodes in 1 month. 
So i wanna ask does it really happen this way? Do usually composers do all this work in just 1 month and are they able to work on multiple projects like this??

Here are screenshots of my 2 film reels around 17 and 20 mins. Link:- https://imgbox.com/IUsti6lz .",1667391140.0,Composers,9,335,54,1634

The staccato chord progressions is what makes my idea unique from any of my other compositions personally - I really enjoyed making it honestly!

As I mentioned before, the key changes are something I was able to maintain XD - very confusing to smoothly transition from one to another. Using diminished chords, I was able to form some cadences that worked out to my surprise. Everything starts on E major - then gradually the key remains at a happy A Major. Switching to some others, E Major comes back to ultimately sum the calamity of glissandos and dense chords! Haha there's so much going on it's hard to tell anything apart.

Anyways, enjoy!

NOTE that I compose as a hobby (although as a profession, destined in the future) and my attempts at notations and transcriptions into readable sheet music are of my less abilities. I just like to focus on the sound, and the visuals when put into a video - I tend to worry less about the fact that someone would be up for actually learning such an insane arrangement. As complex as it is though, it would probably look like a black mess anyway. Nonetheless, I have done the deed, but I know there's always something to fix, and that there would be an easier way out to whatever I did haha (I'm 15 for gosh sake!)

Not intended for an actual performance (some sections could be manageable)

Also in some measures I used Voice 2 format for the additional occurrences of added notes since I wanted everything to look as neat as possible. I'm thinking I didn't use the right time signature (plainly just 4/4), so if anyone could tell me the preferred one, that would be great! :D

yhfq3r,Question - Newbie Alert,"Hi, 

I'm a newbie learning guitar.  I wanted to compose my own music, in software (preferably free). 

I'm good at learning through Trial and error, so I wanted to compose my own (bad) music, and learn music theory from those mistakes, not the other way around.  This model personally works so better for me.   

However, I have no idea how to start and what software tutorials to learn to start composing. 

Kindly guide me in the first step of learning composing.  

Thanks in advance :)",1667140307.0,Composers,4,104,23,490

Another would be from Thought by Jason Richardson. The chord progression alternates between Eb Lydian mode and Bb aeolian mode. Would using a Tonnetz help? How could I use a circle of 5ths to create these unique kinds of progressions?",1667058178.0,Composers,15,125,73,583

ygjz82,Tips for “modern” flute writing,"I put “modern” in quotes because just because it’s current doesn’t mean you need to feel compelled to write Ferneyhough-level chicken scratch that takes a year to learn and isn’t worth the calories. So, for anyone writing for flute:

Hard for the sake of hard is pretentious. Just because a professional flutist can technically play it doesn’t mean a professional flutist will.

Writing tonal music that is lovely to listen to and fun to play is neither irrelevant nor the sign of an immature composer. Airat Ichmouratov’s Flute Concerto, which is brand-spanking-new, is tricky as hell but super enjoyable and there’s not so much as a multiphonic or spit attack in the whole darn thing.

Be authentic and write what you want. If you use a pirate’s hoard of extended techniques purely because you think that’s what you’re supposed to do, it will be neither a joy to write or perform. Or hear. And it will be obvious to the player.

But, if there are effects you want to go for but don’t know how to notate them, describe them in words as thoroughly as you can and hand them off to a flutist to see what can be done. We love that shit. Hell, send it to me. That’s literally my thing, especially on Reddit.

Speaking of extended techniques:

Spit attacks are cool and easy to do. Same for singing and playing. It’s harder if I have to sing different notes than I'm playing, but it's totally doable and a fun effect.

Fluttertongue is standard. I actually use my throat instead of my tongue because my tone is much clearer this way and I can get all the way down to the lowest note. But this is a me thing -- I'm sure there are plenty of flutists who can accomplish the same with their tongue.

If you're going to write multiphonics (2 or more notes played simultaneously by way of a multitude of alternate fingerings) have a reason for doing so. Do your research, make sure they are actually playable, and provide the fingering in the score. In my opinion this is one of the most overused, overrated, and poorly written effects on the flute. Nevertheless, Ian Clarke's The Great Train Race and Michael Colquhoun's Charanga have excellent examples of this effect, and it's no coincidence that both composers are also flutists.

Most professional flutists have access to a low B, so don't be afraid of this note.

Most importantly: write what you want to hear, not what you think others expect of you. And if you've got something cool you're writing and you're worried it's too hard, write it anyway or else you are liable to talk yourself out of discovering something bad-ass. **Modifying a piece according to what you think is playable is tantamount to saying ""I know more about your instrument than you do.""**",1667050920.0,Composers,7,573,31,2707
ygeky8,Obsessed with festive overture. In the beginnings of arranging a horn octet and though I would share my progress.,"https://youtu.be/XFvL7KdM6Uk


I know it’ll probably be too hard for me to ever play but hopefully I’ll be able to record snippets of it and get a real life rendition. I also wanted to know y’all’s opinion on using a score/copy pasting parts from an official score to arrange. I can arrange by ear but I’m a full time engineering student who does music as a hobby so I don’t really have time for that for what I’m trying to do. I found an exact copy of the original score from MuseScore so I’ve been copy pasting chunks (while still moving stuff around and balancing and stuff) so I don’t have to spend time typing out runs and such. Do y’all think that’s a shameful practice or is it just a part of modern composition?",1667033765.0,Composers,21,165,113,719
ygc0u4,How to sound impressionistic on piano?,"Hi, I am a piano and guitar player. I know a fair amount of scales, modes, and chord scale theory.. I know some basic functional chord progressions, chromatic mediants, the 2 5 1, and circle of fifths progressions. I know extended chord and that I have to break out of functional harmony and use modes, avoid leading tones and resolutions(especially dominant to tonic), use multiple keys/modes together, exotic scales, etc…).

ygboth,Any experts on mensural notation?,"I'm trying to learn to read this stuff and some of the rhythmic conventions (if you can call everyone doing things slightly differently even within the same piece a ""convention"") are tough to get a hold of.  

In particular I've been studying [this well-known piece](https://imgur.com/0r79UwB) by Cordier, and some of the choices I don't quite understand.  I've marked up this document with a few red arrows.  In every case I don't get why these notes were used to indicate the supposed note value.  I would have expected a semibreve in place of the minim for the first arrow (D), a breve in place of the semibreve for the second (D again), and again a semibreve on the third (C#).  I assume it's because these are all notes terminating a ternary group so they just naturally fill out that space, but it still seems an odd choice to specifically use minims when it would have been easier and clearer otherwise.  But then I've noticed ars subtilior composers weren't exactly all about ""clear.""  

And in that regard, I'd like to know why he used color to indicate the proportional change the first time it occurs but then uses ""3"" to denote the exact same proportional change the next two times it occurs.  I assume it has something to do with the fact that he's in prolatorio maior during those sections, but I don't really see why that would matter.

yfze87,Who is you favorite film composer and what is your favorite film?,"I would like to start a discussion today about one of the most  specialized crafts in music: film  scoring. This is the only way a composer can get wealthy with his/her writing skills. (Correct me if  I'm wrong.)  I want to know, who’s your favorite and why? What is your favorite film score and why? The members of this sub have the understanding and analytic  skills to start a robust discussion.

  First, I believe it is a consensus among everyone that John Williams is the GOAT. (though not my personal favorite) Speilberg would not be Speilberg without  him.To demonstrate the sheer power of William’s music to evoke emotions, not just on his audience,  but even the performers themselves, I have provided the following link.. (Tissues are recommended)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqVRcFQagtI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqVRcFQagtI)

   Some background.(If anyone gives a rat’s ass). I began a master's program at one  of the world’s top conservatories for arranging and jazz studies. I did well in the first two semesters of arranging, not so well the third semester when we had to arrange for a jazz ensemble and a whole orchestra.

Then I started attending a class in film scoring just before the advent of computer music applications. We were required to use a calculator and a stopwatch.There is no room for error in this field and your conducting skills must be sharp as a razor.  .The final project of this course was to score a TV show which the school bought the rights to. It was the deep end and I was in over my head. I lasted one week before I switched my concentration to music ed/jazz ed. Some of my classmates, a few of whom I am still in touch with, went on to lucrative and rewarding careers. One of whom did the score to a well known series on Netflix.   

Film scoring is more science than art. They  have many arrows in their slings and the greats know when to use them. The scorers take a deep dive into works of the great composers. If I could sum  up “Baroque” in  one word it would be “fancy”. If I could sum up “Romantic”, it would be “emotional.”. The late Romantic composers especially, were experts at evoking emotions. Think Mahler’s Adagietto from the 5th symphony. It evokes passionate love to  me. Richard  Strauss was a master at telling vivid stories without words with his tone poems. The composers of the twentieth century gave film scorers more tools to evoke terror, chaos and humor. Bartok’s ”Music For Strings, Percussion and Celesta” can unsettle any listener.And  then you have atonality...

  I’ve already been too verbose. I want to know your favorite  film composer and/or film score.  Share with us who, what and why. And if anybody gives a monkey’s, I’ll share mine with all of you.’",1666988155.0,Composers,13,569,65,2749
yfxpyx,"Overture for flute, guitar, accordion & cello","Here's a recording of my new concert overture for flute, guitar, accordion & cello, performed by the wonderful Hiss quartet. It's an intense piece, which begins with a march-like idea, which forms the basic idea of the piece. After each cadence, the piece calms down and begins to build again from a single tone.  


I originally intended a piece like this as an opener for a larger work, which would have taken ideas from 17th and 18th century concertos and concerto grossos. I wasn't able to make that idea work very well so I decided to instead focus the ideas I had and make a solid single-movement work. I hope you like it!

I  wrote this piece about five years ago when I was going through depression. I spent a lot of my days just laying in bed and wasting days on my phone. I didn’t have the motivation to get out of bed unless it was to go to my job at the time or to run an important errand. The only thing I really did that was somewhat productive was write music. 

However, this was during a time where I didn’t share that music with anyone, so this is the first time it’s seeing the light of day.  I thought I would take the time to actually record this piece and share that piece of my history with you all today.

yeztx7,How many codas can a piece of music have? Tips on saving space while retaining clarity?,"Working through simple structure/chord sheets for walk on musicians who will be sight reading them, so keeping everything compact is a my end goal. There's a song that goes:

    verse -> prechorus 1 -> chorus
    verse -> prechorus 2 -> chorus

The structure for the verses and choruses are the same, the prechoruses have slight variations. My chart looks like:

- verse (**to coda**)

- prechorus 1

- chorus (**D.C. al Coda** *[back to verse]*)

- (**coda**) prechorus 2

- chorus

The verse, prechorus, and chorus sections all have multiple endings, so I don't think it would improve clarity to stick the two prechoruses as endings within a big repeat like this:

    ||: verse -> prechorus [1] [2] -> chorus :||

My other thought was using two different kinds of codas to point to the verse and chorus separately, but I don't know enough to do that.

If this is making any sense to anyone at this point, does anyone have recommendations? ~~Not sure if I'm allowed to post a link to the .pdf of the sheet, but I can DM it to anyone who wants to see it.~~

yctmvb,Guide to Classical Melodies?,"We all know that classical composers around the “1st Viennese School” (as stupid as that phrase is) used common harmonic practices, many drawing inspiration from foundational theorists like Fux.

Are there then similar treatises written around that time or slightly before that talk about melody? I ask because just as there are recognizable harmonic features of late classical music, there are also certain stylistic melodic markers common in Viennese music of the time. As somebody who loves the melodies of composers like Schubert, it would be of great interest if there were any extant information of what would have informed the melodic dimension of his music.",1666665115.0,Composers,5,117,28,665

The idea is that we have a meeting once a week to talk about our progress and motivate each other to improve.  Also this group would be a great way to get feedback on our music and grow as musicians. Obviously we can have chats whenever we want.

Other oppurtunities are:

* Sharing interesting videos and educational content
* Recommending music, soundtracks and more
* Talk about live and unrelated stuff
* Ask questions about all things music and have others explain it to you
* Create study groups and goals
* Create composition / orchestration challanges

I want you to take this serious so you would need at least...

... to be a full time composer (or are working towards it)

...be at most weekly meetings and engage with the server regularly

...writing orchestral music (you can also work with other genres, but your focus should at least partialy be the orchestra)

...be open to both classical styles and film / video game music

...probably still earlier in your career and still in the heavy studying phase

it's been a while. I should be busy with my master thesis and the conversion of a soundtrack I'm working on but I had a decent idea for a boss battle theme a few days ago, after getting this one piece from Carmina Burana stuck in my head.

I'm quite a bit proud of the orchestration. Always struggled with that since music university but it has gotten much better in recent years. Also, experimenting with rhythm changes and stuff is always fun, lol.

The render is just Noteperformer in Dorico but I mastered it with Ozone 9 so it should sound ok. As always, Noteperformer does an excellent job at interpreting the music. If only the samples sounded better. That's why I can't wait to get back to my appartment because then I can redo the piece in Cubase with the really good samples.

Until then, enjoy and tell me what you think!

I'd shared a version of this a while ago but some sections have been updated a lot and others have had minor edits and dynamics and articulations changed.

I worked it up in Musescore but took a NotePerformer trial to get a better recording, which worked well in the expressive sections but still sounds a little anaemic at louder dynamics. I’ve heard Musescore 4’s new sound engine and it’s approaching the same expressiveness but maybe still needs a bit of development to get instruments sounding consistent with each other, I didn’t feel it was fair post up that audio yet as it’s still in Beta.

The preamble is to clarify that it’s not a tune about a baby, which is most people’s first response. :)

yas4y2,LXI (2021) - A contemporary piece for solo cello,"Hey!

This was the first piece I wrote at Gothenburg University, a school that pushed me to to explore and learn more about contemporary music. 

Our assignment was to write a piece for solo cello that consists of only five notes (which could be used in any octave). In preparation we looked at several pieces, including a piece written for conductor Paul Sacher, where the composer used the notes existing in his surname. I was inspired by this and took a similar approach, but a bit more extensive...

---

As I only had two notes in my name (A and B, from Albin), I decided to do it differently. So I numbered the alphabet where

A = 1 = c

B = 2 = c#

C = 3 = d

D = 4 = d#

etc...

My name of five letters would then give me five notes, although that wasn't quite true. B = 2 = c#, and my last letter N = 13 = c#, giving me the same note twice. My surname's initial is M, which gives the same note as A does, so I decided to take my middle name's initial, J.

This gave me the five letters: A, L, B, I, J, and their corresponding notes: c, b, c#, g#, a. This did however also add more letters, since notes have two or three corresponding letters, giving me a total of twelve letters:

A  B  I  J  L  M  N  U  V  X  Y  Z

The letter's numbers added together becomes 61, written as LXI in roman numerals, the title of the piece. So having arrived with a subset of letters, I decided to write a Swedish poem using only those ones.

From this, I suddenly had the exact order of the notes of the piece. All that was left was the artistic choices of articulation, dynamics, techniques, and so on. 

---

This was quite the process, but it was really fun to try this way of composing. It also made me aware of other ways to convey emotions with music without the freedom of pitch.

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 435 people have responded with over 700 unique composers in their rankings. The average voter submits a list 11 composers long. 

I am wanting 1000 participants by New Years 2023 (or whichever comes first.) I am almost _halfway_ there thanks to all of you! Trends are no doubt starting to appear as more responses come in.

This is _not_ a poll for ranking which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : The instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it.

   But the hard truth is this: nobody wants to hear your fucking music.A painter or photographer can get people to take a look at their work in 15-30 seconds. Listening to your music takes up peoples time, which they usually don’t have a lot of.
    I had a side gig as a ballet & modern dance musician at a local university. I was officially an “adjunct “ professor “, meaning I was paid a chicken and two bushels of barely. A semester. But I had so much fun at this gig. As a musician, making people dance-even if it’s just one drunk couple in a dive-is one of the most satisfying feeling I’d ever have. Getting young  athletic men and women to move to my music is adrenaline! I had a great relationship with the dance instructor. She was a modern hippy chick who choreographed to a whole melange of genres. She loved what I played in class and encouraged improv and spontaneity. I ad libbed 
A tune one day she said “that’s beautiful! Play it again tomorrow!” I was so encouraged that I started orchestra ting the tune on GB. I spent an entire cross country flight immersed in the project. When i got it where I was somewhat satisfied,I sent the file to that professor telling her I  was under no  expectation for her to choreograph anything to it. (Yeah well, that was BS) She never listened to it. Not once. Even after a few months. I still loved working with her.
    I finally arrived at the “aha moment “ when I gave my headphones to my cousin, who played drums in my band, to tell me what he thought of it. He had them on for maybe 15 seconds, handed them back and patronizingly said “ that’s real good.” So then I said I’m not gonna take it personally this is just the way human nature works. I’m gonna do me and if no one wants to listen to it, including my mama, I’ll keep my day job and keep writing. But it made me realize how so very very difficult it must be to break into any kind of a market of recorded music when really almost no one wants to take the time to hear it no matter how good it may be.

y7o3r5,Writing a two part invention,"
J.S. Bach composed his set of two-part inventions (click here to get a copy of them) as both instructional material for keyboard pedagogy as well as to embody basic contrapuntal principles.

I’ve outlined here a process for composing a simple invention based on Bach’s model.  You will need knowledge of common practice harmony and basic counterpoint to proceed.  Enjoy!


Compose a thematic motive. It should be divisible into two distinct cells (no more–the essence here is simplicity). Bear in mind that later this will be used for sequence, inversion, and other manipulations. It should have strong harmonic implication.  Write this out in the upper part in the first measure.

Write an answer to that theme in the lower voice in the tonic key.   It’s generally best for the answer to be an octave lower than the upper part.

Compose a counterpoint above the answer in the first voice. This is called the countertheme and it will make several more appearances. The relationship between the two voices should be double counterpoint.

Continue on in the upper part with the theme, but this time it should be on the dominant.

Under this dominant presentation, the lower voice presents the countertheme (can be slightly varied).  Follow this with the theme on the dominant.

At this point, you will begin planning out sequences (two or three) that will set up a modulation to V (III if you started in a minor key).

Begin the sequence with fragments of the theme in the upper part, then the lower part. When you get close to the cadence point (where the modulation will be realized), you may further fragment the theme.

The counterpoint to the theme during this series of sequences should be derived from the countertheme.

The cadence itself may be written with some freedom in order to give a sense of arrival.

This concludes the exposition of the invention.

Since you are now in the key of the dominant (or III), you will begin with the theme in this key, though unlike the exposition, you will begin with the theme in the lower part.  This second portion of the invention proceeds much as the first, though the sequences will proceed to a new related key (vi, ii, ii, or IV if in major, v VI, or iv if in minor).

The final section usually starts out with sequences, with the theme alternating between the parts.  The final cadence is sometimes delayed by deceptive sequences.

This process results in a simple invention based on Bach’s first invention.  Study the others closely to note other ways of composing these intriguing little works!",1666140354.0,Composers,5,506,28,2551
y7j1re,Can you play a perfect fourth on a natural horn/trumpet?,"Just trying to understand how this works. 

I've read that the natural horn/trumpet can only play notes from its overtone series, which in C would be C, C, G, C, E, G and so on and so on. 

So, in the key of C, we simply could not play a perfect fourth interval if we were playing with two natural trumpets for example? We couldn't play a C on one of them and an F on another? Further more, we couldn't play a melody on a natural trumpet that goes C - F - C - F - C?

y6dzh6,How do composers that can't read sheet music notate their music?,"Thought that just recently crossed my mind. For me the process is kinda reversed. I come in with ideas and complete 80-90% digitally and engraving may be complicated, but it's not a big issue for me, because obviously I can read what I'm doing. It simply takes time, for example something I've been working on recently is technically complete to share, but the engraving process is taking extra time for me (simply because I'm messy and inexperienced).

Now that is my perspective. Consider you sit down next to a piano and start composing (so you don't work digitally), but you also don't read notes (as some of the best artists of our time do). Do you type out the letters on a sheet of paper? Do you just record and play by ear? Or do you have to sit down with a DAW after finishing your session to sort of save your process.

y5tcyt,Block-Harm Rhapsody (2021) - A jazz big band piece,"Hey!

Block-Harm Rhapsody was originally written as a small assignment for a music theory course, specifically about block harmonization. However I liked the piece so much that I expanded on it to a fully fledged piece. I like the way this piece moves between different genres and atmospheres quite haphazardly, which is also the cornerstone of the Rhapsody as a musical form.

---

Firstly it establishes the main theme, then moves on to more of a laid back swing, coming back to a slightly more rigid theme variant, moving on to a kind of Mario Kart-esque vibe, building up to a heavy metal breakdown, and finally collapsing over itself in a third, more drunken variation of the theme. Quite the ride!

The main theme is heavily reliant on the shifting odd time signature groove:

7/8 + 9/8 + 7/8 + 4/4

Subdivided as follows:

3+2+2 --- 3+2+2+2 --- 3+2+2 --- 2+2+2+2

As it turns out, though not unexpected, this was more difficult to play than I had anticipated... However as a student it's all part of the process. The rest of the piece however is a bit more straight forward.

---

The piece was written in the Spring of '21, then polished over the next year and [performed by Gothenburg Jazz Orchestra 6th of June '22.](https://youtu.be/G_79qUqDZe0?t=74) I wish we had a bit more time to rehearse, but hopefully I'll get the chance for it to be played again in the future!

Hi, While I have been playing music all my life I have finally started dipping my toes into writing original music for our band and i have no idea what I'm doing really. The band is built of a Singer, Trumpet, Trombone (that's me), Electric guitar, Electric base guitar and Drums.

What I have mainly focused on in this score, and want critiqued is song structure, chord progression, trumpet-trombone melody and base line. The drum beat and guitar is very rudimentary and there only to anchor the rest. Song melody or lyrics is not included.

What I'm most uncertain about is:

* The song structure which to me feels like five separate ideas slapped together and I'm uncertain if the really fit well together.
* The intro melody does not feel groovy at all (Too basic? To happy? Annoying?)

However I appreciate any and all constructive comments, brutal honesty is welcome. Thanks!

For ease of reference the song pars are: 

[I]ntro melody (8 bars), Part A (8 bars), Part B (8 bars), Part C (8 bars), Part D (11 bars), [O]utro Melody (11 bars)

&#x200B;

Edit: just to add, because some people are introducing strawmen logical fallacies into the discussion. My point is that voice does not have to be gendered. That's it. And I'm sharing my process with you. I'm not stating which voice types are gendered and which aren't, so it doesn't matter whether it's SATB or any sub category of those. Some of you are coming back with 'but women can sing bass; men can sing soprano' (this is confusing pitch and timbre: I'm not talking about vocal ranges. I'm talking about how vocal timbres are inextricably linked to gender).  I'm also talking about tradition vs today. Please note my use of the word 'traditional'. My point is that voice is not inherently gendered today (the world of trans opera singers demonstrates this), but traditional classifications ARE based on gender. This isn't news. I'm not claiming anything new here and this aspect is not my research. This point is common knowledge in opera and is in all the relevant literature. My research is in rethinking traditional opera and working with trans voices.

And I DO know what I'm talking about. I sang in a children's choir on TV and radio, then cathedral choir on TV and radio for years, I have a PhD in contemporary classical composition, I have my grade 8 in classical voice from Trinity, I am a qualified lecturer (AFHEA) and I discuss all this research in depth on my YouTube channel where I talk about the process of composing this opera and also my research into traditional voice categories (explored in relation to perspectives today).",1665856164.0,Composers,6,440,35,2238

I want to give a huge shoutout to [Kymatic](http://kymatic.space/eng/) for performing my piece Codex Praxis at the Sensor Festival in Armenia. It's rare and very special for a piece of this scale to get put on out in the world, and I'm extremely honored and thankful to have had this out there and to have it so thoughtfully and artistically explored. 

With this piece, I wanted to take ideas from medieval and renaissance music, liturgical drama, etc. and map it onto my own aesthetic. There is still drama in the work, but much more abstract. In a way, I wanted this piece to be something of a ""found document."" I wanted to write the piece as if I were an anthropologist who found an old forgotten manuscript from a monk who traveled and witnessed a strange musical ritual and then tried to recreate it.",1665680183.0,Composers,6,196,56,961

I hope me asking this can help others frame their approach to/experiences with potentially similar situations (I was unable to find a preexisting post that talks about this specific thing).

Some context, in short: I recently landed my first video game gig and it's been going really great after a solid few months. The team is really small, everyone's super cool, and I love everything about the concept and characters. Contract has been signed, nothing fishy or felt unfair, but I realized some weeks in that it made no mention of an original soundtrack or how that would look if one was planned.

From my understanding (which may be incorrect as I'm still new to this), game audio composers generally don't collect traditional publisher/master royalties from the games they work on, but could if an OST for the game is created (due to streams/purchases/etc.)

That said, for those of you who have created music/audio for games which put out an OST, what were your experiences in navigation? Were there agreements or compromises appended to your preexisting contract? Did you keep all/partial rights? Did you initiate the idea of releasing the OST? Whatever you'd like to share on the topic.

Sixteen minutes, the journey's been worth it. Originally I was planning on writing four concertos, around 10 minutes each (imagine). This alone is over 40 now, I feel this is quite enough for the seasonals this year. I've got a fine ship to pilot now, gold and crimson in color - it's time to find a crew… to set sail. This is what I realized.

I decided to break this up into five passages to help follow the score (post-composition):

I. Exposition and subject introduction: strings -> piano -> + brass -> flute, timpani & winds -> strings and trio (1-128)

II. Development: mainly strings and trio (129-266)

III. Trio I: orchestra -> violin solo I -> duo I -> trio I (267-460)

IV. Trio II: orchestra -> trio -> violin solo II -> duo II -> trio II (461-642)

V. Recapitulation and finale: strings -> orchestra -> piano solo & finale (643-849)

Violin solo I starts at 5:41 (312)

Violin solo II starts at 9:53 (529)

I get the gist of making money composing - royalties and such build up over time. Can I expect to live comfortably at all though? Anything above $50k a year eventually?

xxdzqz,"""Stream"" for clarinet in Bb & live electronics","Here's a small solo piece for clarinet & live electronics I composed this summer. The piece alternates between fast passages and long, sustained pitches. The electronics in this piece is a simple reverb patch I created in pure data, which is controlled by a sustain pedal by the player. Similar effect could be created with any commercial vst or a hardware pedal but I decided to create it in pd because it's free and hence accessible for anyone. The reverb pedal adds sustain to certain pitches mainly on the cadential passages of the piece. The name of the piece comes from an allusion of a stream of something I had when composing this piece. When the reverb patch is switched on, I felt the 'stream' was spilling over. I hope you like it!

Organized by Access Contemporary Music, Spudnik Press, and Homeroom Chicago, we were tasked to create art based on the idea words of ""cold"", ""cool"", ""blue"", and ""green"".  

We were inspired by the weather in Chicago at that time in the spring of 2013, the slow dripping of melting ice, and the feeling of waking up again after hibernation. 

Back in 2013 when I wrote this, I was really pushing myself to compose ""outside of my box"" because I felt like a lot of my music was sounding the same (as naturally happens when finding one's voice). While I don't love that I used certain beaming styles of Finale 😆, I am particularly pleased with the textures that I wrote. I would definitely notate things a little differently 10 years later, but all in, it's a piece I'm happy with.

xw1pk2,Shout out to Margaret Brouwer,"Some time ago the Logan HS Winterguard used Margaret Brouwer's Sonata for Horn and Piano for their show (I think 2005?) and, before I knew what the piece was called, I thought it was just some dreamy piece for horn and really loved it. And I really wanted to play it. But I'm a flutist.

So, two summers ago I finally emailed her and said, essentially, ""I love this piece and I really wish it was written for flute. Would you be cool with me arranging it and performing it?"" which I felt a little weird about doing because it's such a personal piece for her, and quite a famous one. And, in all fairness, her initial response was ""Well...OK, but it's a horn piece. So. Um?"" but she relented. And to my relief she actually was happy with the test recordings I sent over from rehearsal.

I'm saying all this because this was a seriously bad-ass, generous thing for an established composer for her to do for someone she didn't even know, and certainly didn't need to do at all even if the piece weren't as famous as it actually is. And I want everyone to know about it. In fact, my next recital of other, similarly bad-ass music for flute and piano (on which this piece features heavily) is literally entitled ""One of These Pieces Was Written for Horn but Margaret Brouwer Let Me Arrange It for Flute Because She's a Boss.""

xuzy3g,Three Poems for Voice and Piano Quartet,"Original text, all words and music are my own. First drafts for just piano and voice completed October 2021. Full score and parts finished in late March 2022. As I say in my composer note, the original idea was an art song as requested by the singer, but the piece I wrote first (""Unique"") turned out really musical theater-y, and I realized it would work better as the end of a short song cycle. All three are in different styles, with harmonic language and phrase structure varying greatly. Even the texts are varied--the first is very through composed, with no rhyme scheme; the second is quite square, with a sort of arch form that grows in the middle and comes back down; and the third has really snappy trick rhymes with varied rhythms. As you might be able to tell from this, I ended up spending more time on the text and text-setting than the music--it was so satisfying for me the way it all came together. My interpreter was spectacular as well--I had a really clear idea of what I wanted and we spent a lot of time in rehearsal discussing the various characters and ideas.

I. Alarmed - A character who seems tormented by her alarm clocks (represented in the accompaniment) may actually be dealing with some deeper anxieties.  
II. Wallflower - A painfully shy individual dreams of opening up to others.  
III. Unique - An egomaniac gives us a horrifying and oblivious glimpse into what it's like to be truly one-of-a-kind.

Really, all of these songs are just about connecting, and show characters who struggle to do so or feel misunderstood, or are fighting themselves in their own way. I hope you enjoy and I hope you recognize yourself in some way.

My big brag on this piece is that Lori Laitman, who is such a prolific art song composer that her website is literally [artsongs.com](https://artsongs.com), loved them and gave me positive feedback on the score and performance.

I am trying a new technique (reinforcement learning) which tries to teach to the computer how to play ""For Elise"" the left hand. The computer learns by playing games, so to say: Each game consists of the computer playing some note (pitch, duration, volume, isrest). If it plays the next expected note of ""For Elise"", then it gets say +1 point. If it hits a note which sound similar but not the expected one, then it gets -1 points. It tries to maximize the expected reward. It can learn the first few notes very quickly ( after a few minutes, but then somehow it gets stuck.)

Here is what it has learned after 1840 games and random initialization:

The internal view is, that it sees the last four notes played and after playing three consecutive wrong notes it is game over.

My naive question for composers is this:

I am not trying to literally let the computer learn the piece, as this would be somehow boring at the end.

What I am trying to do, is to learn to play in a similar sound as the original piece.

So my very naive question is this: Suppose you would teach a novice composer to learn to imitate a given piece of music. How would you do that? What would be the right ""reward"" for this? (If this question makes any sense... as I can understand that it is very naive and open ended)

So, I've reviewed the FAQ: ""music in non-classical styles or at least in styles that branch from classical styles is more than welcome if accompanied by a score."" But I still have some imposter syndrome here given the amazing, fully orchestrated work others are posting. It's hopefully a painless 1:22 of your time.

I'm working in a musical theater program, auditioning for composer. The song is inspired by the movie *The Big Sick.* The concept is based on the protagonist (a budding standup comedian) struggling on stage as he contemplates the gravity of his loved one's illness. 

I'm deliberately trying for an early 1960s movie soundtrack style, ala Henry Mancini. 

Some questions: 

\- Do you think the melody is poignant and suitable to the intent? 

\- Are the modulations and other chromaticism too much? Too little? (The modulation framework is lifted from Carole King's song Tapestry)

\- In terms of arrangement: the requested instrumentation is oboe over piano. But this will be sung by a baritone. I am wondering if I should flip the piano accompaniment staffs, so eighth notes RH, chords LH. (Obvously need to re-voice the chords more openly if LH). 

\- Playability: I am by training a guitarist with very basic ""arrangers piano"" skills. Is the accompaniment playable? Seems like the LH would be a workout. Also I think the pedaling gets a little muddy. 

\- Overall: Is this professional quality work,  ready for prime time? Obviously subjective, but let me have your thoughts. I have a pretty thick skin, the composing faculty have been making me do a lot of rewrites :-)

This piece comes after making the mistake of starting my composition journey with film scoring, which led to some issues with learning how to properly structure and conceptualize a piece. I decided to start with a very simple concept, which was characterizing the woodwinds as the “good guys” and the brass as the “bad guys”. The brass would periodically part the veil from behind the woodwinds, eventually blowing away the facade completely. 

Although this piece is done, I’d love to get some advice on how to improve for future pieces! Thanks for listening!

xqqo1f,Seeking composer for a D&D actual play podcast theme,"Hello r/composer! I am looking for someone who can help me out with a podcast theme.

The game is set in Eberron - for those unfamiliar, we have described it as fantasy meets pulp meets noir. Magic is widely available, with most people knowing at least a cantrip or two, but rarely are people able to cast over fifth level spells. Set on the continent of Khorvaire, the game will follow a party of three as they navigate adolesence, grief, politics, and conspiracy in a rapidly developing world.

The game is set four years after The Mourning - a cataclysmic event that blanketed a whole country in a layer of mist and brought forth unspeakable horrors to the land - at the culmination of a war lasting over 100 years. The war ended not at a peaceful resolution, but out of fear - with the warring nations afraid they would be next, a ceasefire was called, and the continent is in an unstable peacetime. Halfings ride dinosaurs in the plains of the east, while demon tribes and ancient evils dominate the lands of the west.

Our thoughts on the music are as follows; we would like elements of general fantasy themes, but would also love heavier inspiration from swing and jazz music styles. The piece should be up to 45 seconds long, ideally with a solid introduction befitting a podcast.

We thought that it could start with a sweeping fantasy opening, and after a few seconds, cut to a more modern, swing/jazz style while maintaining a consistent melody/motif throughout. It would be used both as an introduction and end piece, playing at either end of an episode.

You will receive full payment, full credition, and may retain the rights to the music. As we are a small group at the moment, we would not be able to offer royalties, but we are willing to negotiate commercial licensing.

It's similar to conventional clef notation, but there is no space for ""white"" notes (piano thing).

Then I realised I could go even further. I could set up every note I wanted in this way, I just would need a way of saying what notes would be. So the ""clef"" starts with a bar without measure with the first note meaning the place it ""starts"" and the other notes meaning what notes are in there. All the notes are quarter notes without the | (just the •).

It was basically a C major but with 3rd (E) minor. The piece was fugue no.2 from Well Tempered.
After that, I took some Mozart inspiration to compose and the Symphony 25 (I guess) have a Bb A G F# sequence. When I transposed it from G (minor) to C I got the same scale: major 3rd minor.
Also I tried to ""flat"" the 6th degree and finally the 7th, giving the minor scale.
All this gave me inspirations to study more about these unusual scales (at least for me), but I found almost no information.
Church modes and pentatonic ""fit"" in diatonic scale, so they are not really different stuff.
Also, I tried C E F# G# A B and C D# E F G Ab Bbb, but these kinda sounded wierd.

The average voter submits a list 12 composers long. I will not say which two, but the top two composers are very close to being tied so far.

I am wanting 1000 participants by New Years 2023 ( or whichever comes first). I am one third there thanks to all of you! Trends are no doubt starting to appear as more responses come in.

This is _not_ a poll for ranking which classical composers are objectively best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be Warned : The instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. You are able to edit your responses up until the 31st of December if you wish to.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorite—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it.

xlvs5s,Piano composers expected to be performers as well,"What’s the community view on the perception I have of the classical music world’s expectation that composers of piano music should also be the performers of said music?

To illustrate; I have several albums of music by composers such as Chas Lawson, Dustin O’Halloran, Ludovico Einaudi, Rachel Grimes, Oskar Schuster, Nils Frahm, et al. and I don’t think I’ve a single recording of even one of their works played by any other than themselves. Meanwhile, I’ve got recordings made by Lang Lang, Daniel Barenboim, Vanessa Benelli Mosell, Martha Argerich, et al. and none of them play music they’ve written, if any of them have ever written anything at all. 

I look through my own recording library of classical music and I can see a trend. Composers of most any other type of music are left to be composers and little more; living composers of piano solo works are usually the sole performers of their work. It seems you can be a professional composer of orchestral music, choral music, chamber music, and ensemble music amongst other forms, and remain behind the page, focused entirely on the writing of said music. But if you compose for a pianist *you* are the pianist. 

The reason this rubs me the wrong way is pretty simple; I’m not a performer. I did a music degree and ditched performance after it became optional in my second year. I hated doing it in first year so I wasn’t going to carry it. I focused my studies mostly on theory, history, and of course composition. I am comfortable playing my own music for myself and others who happen to hear me at home. I’ve been known to sit down at a public piano once or twice too, granted. But I believe to be a true performer, I would need to dedicate a great number of hours and days, months and years to honing my craft. But I already did and continue to do that; as a composer. If you want to hear one of my pieces played with the odd wrong note here or there fine, I’ll play it. But you’d want your money back on that CD/recording wouldn’t you.

I also believe that the performer has equal value to the realisation of a piece as the composer themselves. I wrote it and I know what it wanted to say; now I want to hear what you think it says and then hear it say it. Think about how different different performers’ performances of the same pieces can sound. The phrasing, tempi, colourisation, lightness of touch, everything can be subtly influential to the final realisation of a piece. And I want to hear that. I want to sit in the audience and be as mesmerised as they are. 

As a final point (complaint?), do we not feel that by expecting composers of piano solo to be their own performers, we’re creating an unnecessary barrier to having certain composers’ music getting beyond the page or their own piano? I certainly feel like it’s a barrier of mine.

It took me a bit more time than I hoped, but here is a second composition.

Since the first one was too complex for what I can do, I tried to have something simpler: 3/4 without having polyrythm. This composition (like the first one) has the license CC-by-SA. So, feel free to do almost whatever you want with it.

xkdj2y,How To Analyze/Deconstruct A Score?,"So, I know a big part in learning music and composition is analyzing a deconstructing scores; really getting into the way it sounds and *why* it sounds that way.

I can do simpler things like reading notes, recognizing the intervals, and know (or can google) the specific contexts/shorthand that mark the score.

But I also know that's only scratching the surface of a piece of music: it's important to know, but those blocks build into something grander, a larger image. Things like themes, repeated motifs, and probably things I can't think of right now, all add flavor and nuance to the underlying notes.

Ultralocrian scale is 1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 bb7

I was trying a some weird scale

This is B Ultralocrian (have B C D Eb F G Ab)

For key signature idk what better key signature with 3 flats or 2 sharps

(3 flats would use from relative minor key (accidential is B natural)

2 sharps was use from parallel minor key (accidential is F natural, C natural, Eb, Ab))

but i think i stick with 3 flats because it use less accidential)

xihdw4,_sidestory (Flute and Electronics),"Hi, I'm a senior highschooler aspiring to be a composer in the future. I'll be applying for music school in a few months. Anyway that doesn't matter. I just wanted to share some music. 

I believe it's one of the few pieces I am actually happy with. I experimented very boldly on this one. I had never used electronics before so it was my first time programming Pure Data. It was also the first time using a Lachenmann inspired ideas for a full length piece. And most importantly, it was the first time I actually wrote about my life events.

If you listen carefully, the fixed media is from the 1999 Columbine Massacre. I wasn't there. I wasn't even born yet. However, gradually learning about the massacre, I learned a few lessons that really resonated with me. And so, I decided to write about it. I try to make the piece as non-political as possible as I don't mean to comment on the incident itself. I have opinions. However, I only use the incident as a means of expression.

If anyone reads the performance notes, I do apologize. I tried my best to make it clear and concise... It's more difficult than it looks.

I'm welcome to any feedback, especially from experienced composers. I want to see how you guys tear down my favourite piece. For myself, I believe I lack a personal voice. The music sounds a bit generic to me. However, I didn't have time to fix that.

Links are on the bottom. I won't give out the electronic files as I'm a bit afraid of someone stealing them. However, if you DM me, I can send them to you. Thanks in advance for anyone who chooses to give me feedback. Have a nice day!

xi92zx,First Light - The first track from my upcoming album,"Hello everyone!  


I wanted to jump on and share the first piece from my recently recorded album, 'This Too Shall Pass'. The album was originally released in 2019, with the intent of expressing my experiences living with Bipolar Disorder and undergoing electroconvulsive therapy in hospital. The original album was released using sample library mockups. Since the original release I have had 3 further courses of ECT, and several months ago ran a Kickstarter to raise the funds to record an updated version of the album with a live orchestra. The recording session happened just over a month ago, but I have unfortunately been back in hospital for another course of treatment. The good news is I have managed to get one of the tracks together for release, and wanted to share it with you all. 

This piece, titled First Light, was written for a very specific moment of my original treatment. I had been in a severely deep depression (to the point of making an attempt on my life), and the ECT was a last resort for me. The morning of my 5th treatment, I came to and went outside to have my morning coffee - and I felt sunlight for the first time in months. I do not know if you have ever experienced a deep depression but even things like feeling the warmth of the sun can be lost. So this moment was a truly massive breakthrough in my treatment, and became the basis of this piece.

I have linked both the score and video of the recording session below, and I do hope you enjoy it. I am sorry for making you read so much as well!

Hello folks!

I just finished my latest composition and wanted to share it with you.  
After several months of writer's block, I finally managed to compose something I'm happy with again (:  
I've been following this subreddit for 1 year now and wanted to contribute something as well....

Brief info about me: m(17), piano for 10 years and composing for 2 years.

About the piece itself: It was the 1st piece I composed 100% on the computer. So my writing process was also quite different, which I actually found quite refreshing. While accidentally playing the A theme backwards, I noticed that it sounds relatively baroque, which inspired me to write the B theme (basically the A theme, but backwards).

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to making a proper recording of the piece yet. But I hope that the MIDI file can give you a rough feeling of the piece (:

I wish you a lot of fun with it and I'm looking forward to any kind of criticism!

xgprr9,Voolav Vesi - For viola and piano (2022),"Hey!

In one of my projects in school last year we were to write write a solo piece, and I was assigned the viola. Over several months me and a violist met every other week, I brought my ideas and we got to go through the composition process together. It was really fun and educational being able to workshop your ideas while in the middle of the process, as well as letting the musician be a part of it from the beginning!

I found it difficult to write for only the viola because of the style of music I aspire to create, so I cheated a bit and decided to play the piano along with him... But I think the result was quite beautiful!

Before I go into this story, I want would very mucin appreciate if you checked out the many wonderful musicians that played in this album. I know that would love your support. I could not have completed this album without their help. Please check out their work from the description of the video and let them know that I sent you!

I would also really appreciate if you guys took the time to listen to the album. I know that it is impossible for everyone to go into it right away but it would mean the world to me if you could when you got the chance. This is essentially my life’s work and story up to this point. 

Background:
I’ve made many compositions up to this point throughout my past 10 years of making music. I’ve been really active in this community for the past 5 years, and have grown so much. When I started posting here, I was in college just trying to improve on my composition and arranging skills. I’ve come to a point where I feel that I have discovered my voice through this community. 

When I first got into writing music, I originally was writing for piano and guitar growing up. I was extremely insecure about my voice, even though I was told that I had a soft and pleasant tone. I had ignored my voice for years after being made fun of in middle school for a class when I sang. I didn’t take singing seriously again until college. This is when I began to implement my voice into my compositions. Up to this point, my goal was to simply make soundtrack music, as I was somewhat passionate about it.

However, there was a part of me that wanted to create my own compositions with my voice. A lot of people were tell me that it didn’t quite fit a lot of the time, but this was my music, and part of me wanted to express myself in this way. That’s when I started writing this album. It took about three years to get it out but I can safely say that this is my best to work all encompassed into 8 tracks.

I’ve posted a few of these songs here in this sub-reddit and I have gotten great feedback on them. I genuinely feel like I would not have been able to complete this without your help. I appreciate all of you here. I know we are strangers on the Internet, but we all have a passion for music, and I am grateful that there are spaces like this, where we can learn from each other and grow together.

It truly means the world to me that people take time to listen to my work. I don’t ever plan to get anywhere with my music at this point, as I’m a lot older now. However, I will still continue to express my complicated thoughts and emotions through music. It’s just a part of me and I’m glad to know that I’m not the only one that feels this way.

I'm currently working on my master's in vocal performance & choral conducting, but I've recently found an appreciation for and enjoyment of composing. I've made lots of snippets, but I wanted to share the two complete pieces I've been most proud of:

First is a theme tune named after my D&D campaign, *Annum Draconis*; it's a semi-symphonic orchestral work of sorts and full of fantasy vibes and motives.

[https://youtu.be/TtvrvIQhkRI](https://youtu.be/TtvrvIQhkRI)

Second is one that is mildly still in process, but makes up one complete part of a whole; this is the Introit to a requiem I am working on called *Requiem Respirum,* or restful breath. This movement is acapella, but I've considered orchestrating the rest of the movements. Thoughts? Also, apologies about some of the oddities of the playback on this video, Musescore 4 is a huge improvement IMO but it handles group fermatas weirdly.

Oh, also, the video doesn't include this note relating to the ""\*"" on some words; these words slowly close to the \[m\] sound, like a hum.

109evgk,What is your favorite moment in music?,"What is everyone's favorite moment in music, and how do you think it affects how and what you write (if you think it does, even a little bit)? My favorite moment in music is toward the very end of the cadenza in the Mendelssohn violin concerto, where the soloist is playing some broken chords very close to what the orchestra opens up with at the very beginning, and this leads to the orchestra playing a statement of the opening theme. The reason I like this moment so much is that you don't even realize that Mendelssohn is doing what he's doing until after it's done. I think that I try to recreate this effect with my transitions back to the theme when I use sonata form (for instance, in the first movement of my second symphony (linked at the bottom), I start the end of the development in A major, and then I temporarily modulate to/tonicize E major, before I completely disrupt the moment with E minor stuff, that leads to the theme). I would like to know if I'm alone in this, or is this a common thing that happens with us. I feel like we're in a unique position that other art forms don't get to experience their equivalent of this in the way we do, so I'd like to see what comes of this discussion!

Everyday when I go on the internet, I see hundreds of music-related posts from professional musicians. It makes me feel small and insignificant. Everyday I discover new music that ranges from simple yet inventive catchy pop hits with high production value to bizarre half-hour compositions that utilise techniques which names I can't even pronounce and which notations look like ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. I'll probably never be able to afford tuition and my ADHD stops me from organising effectively and studying by myself. I'm not sure where I'm going in terms of my style/musical preferences and even if I knew, I'd still be oblivious as to how to get there. On top of that I'm constantly accumulating more debts trying to pursue my musical ""career"" (lol).

The funny thing is, if there's one thing I love in this world, it's music. I want to create for the sake of others. I care about art, not money - but I feel corrupted. Every idea is better in my head than in reality, and the place for my musical expression seems nowhere to be found. My output is low and my only real listeners are family members who are highly skeptical of the whole operation.

In December of 2022, I had the honor of having my new piece, Until they've driven out the grief, premiered by a personal hero of mine: mandolinist Alon Sariel. Alon was one of the mandolinists that I listened to constantly when I began my journey with the instrument. He brought a sort of sensitivity to that only the best musicians bring to their work. He was incredible to work with.

The work itself was very personal. I had a pretty awful 2020-2022, had more than one friend and family member pass away, and was not sure if I was going to compose at all after I had completed my master's degree due to severe burnout. Still, I knew I had to give it one last attempt, and so I ended up with this work. Somehow, I convinced Alon to play it. And now I'm composing again.

How do I word this all professionally to the client

And PRO? So I have to register each track I write or send a cue sheet to a place like BMI, ASCAP? How much does that cost? What does that do?

Well, while exploring various AI tools I came across artinfuser, which touts itself as being able to humanize midi files.  Maybe this is technology that's been around for a long time.  I dunno.  But I uploaded the midi file to it that I got from note flight and I don't hate it!

Anyway here is the link to the music video (not the how-to video).  I've probably talked too much.  It's nothing special.  As I said, I'm not a musician.  This was just a little thing I did years ago.  I think the cool part is how it comes together with Artinfuser, Synthesia and Stable Diffusion.

When arranging a medley of multiple different pieces from a single source, how do you suppose you would end it?

I'm currently writing a medley of well-known music from Mariokart, and my natural instinct is to end it with Rainbow Road, which most would consider to be the ultimate track in the series. I don't know, it just seems that the last thing the audience hears should be a little more important than the rest, and if not, it ends up being a glorified playlist. 

I haven't read up on the study of medley-writing (if that even exists...) and, of course, these are just my natural inclinations as an artist. Please let me know your thoughts if you have any, and maybe a different approach to writing a medley. Thanks!",1673840952.0,Composers,3,186,15,906

10c420m,How to write a simultaneous canon & crab canon hybrid!,"(First posted on r/musictheory)

Link to score: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPoyY0JWQJEqn9DcZSIUccMF5FpRmXNK/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPoyY0JWQJEqn9DcZSIUccMF5FpRmXNK/view?usp=sharing)

As a disclaimer, I’m mainly familiar with Renaissance/species counterpoint so that’s where I’m coming from. I owe a ton to Early Music Sources for his videos giving me the foundation to do this in the first place.

Hey y’all, I recently released an intro to a song with some counterpoint that might be interesting to the sub. It’s a crab canon which also works as a canon… *kinda*. In other words, you have a crab canon where the backwards line is playing in imitation just like a canon! For reference, the canon-crab canon hybrid starts 0:48 seconds into [my song](https://soundcloud.com/chromaticswing/a-summary-of-my-inability-to-let-go). Here’s how to make it!

1. *Make a 2 voice imitation* following the rules outlined in [this video by Early Music Sources](https://youtu.be/vpfoiwU4rDI?t=324). This gives you the skeleton over which you will ornament & make your composition. I decided to make an imitation at the 5th below in half notes, so each half note can only move up a 2nd or 4th, down a 3rd or 5th, or repeat. I copied this melodic line, transposed it down a 5th, fixed any accidentals, and made it start with a half measure delay. **The original line is the dux, & the new delayed/transposed imitation is the comes.**
2. *Set the point of inversion.* Unfortunately, here’s where you have to break the canon. There’s a myriad of ways to do so, but I decided to keep it simple and have the inversion occur in the middle of a measure. I took the dux and brought it to where it’s only a 3rd away from the comes, breaking the canon a half note earlier in the previous measure. Now that both voices are a 3rd apart, I had them do a voice exchange, thus facilitating the inversion.
3. *Ornament your skeleton!* This is gonna be the toughest part of the process. Thankfully though, since you are writing a canon up until the inversion, you only have to write for the dux. The skeleton is already a canon. Just copy the corresponding ornamentation onto the comes, write for the dux, etc. However, there are more rules to follow if you want to write in strict counterpoint, because this is also a crab canon.
   1. *You can only write in invertible counterpoint at the 8ve*. Crab canons always invert, so this always applies. Avoid 5ths, & stick to 3rds, 6ths, & 8ves/unisons.
   2. *No suspensions/anticipations.* Since crab canons reverse rhythms, any techniques requiring elements to occur in a strict order must be avoided. I’m sure you can do this in freer styles of counterpoint, but it’s too confusing for me and I’m not that smart. **Honor your skeleton.** Speaking of rhythms…
   3. *Make sure your ornamentations work in both directions!* This is prolly the weirdest rule to follow so bear with me. When rhythms reverse, the last note of an ornamentation becomes the first note. For example in a half note skeleton, quarter note passing notes work because the dissonant note is on an offbeat. However when the rhythms reverse, the dissonant note falls square on a downbeat. No bueno. **As a rule of thumb, make sure your ornamentations start & end on a consonant note - at the very least!** When writing ornamentations which are 2:1, both ornamented notes need to be consonant with the note they’re sounding against. When writing ≥3:1 ornamentations, make sure the middle notes can be justified in your style of counterpoint, both forwards & backwards.
4. *Ornament the inversion.* Your canon should break somewhere here, so you can drop that requirement. But the aforementioned requirements for a crab canon still apply here. Write up until the point of inversion.
5. *Write the reversed version of the piece!* All you need to do is to copy the notes and make sure they mirror their forward counterparts exactly. You’ll notice that some downbeats don’t line up with the skeleton anymore. That’s completely natural. As long as the reversed version still makes a canon, you’ve done it!
6. *(Optional) Make a cadence!* Fill in the delay in the comes with an 8ve or unison. This might not always be possible depending on your skeleton, but it’s worth trying out. Suspensions are not possible if you want to maintain symmetry, but if you can manage to start your melody with movements of 2nds or 5ths, you could possibly end up with a convincing cadence by the end of the piece. I decided to break symmetry at the end of my canon-crab canon hybrid.

And that’s that! Hope my explanations aren’t too confusing. I highly recommend watching not only [the aforementioned video](https://youtu.be/vpfoiwU4rDI) going over how to make your imitation, but also [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGZjzBvXCzg) to see how far imitative counterpoint could be pushed. This technique I outlined is the most restrictive 2 voice strict counterpoint I could think of to compose, aside from making counterpoint simultaneously invertible at the 8ve, 10th, & 12th.

At the very least, I hope this can serve as a helpful exercise which produces cool music with loads of symmetry! Thanks for reading.

—

Addendum: I don’t think canons can exist within crab canons unbroken. On a macro scale, canons move via *parallel motion* by nature. If the dux moves up, the comes must move up eventually, and vice versa. On the other hand, crab canons must move in *contrary motion* at some point to invert. You can definitely place the break in the canon exactly where the piece inverts, but the canon must be broken regardless.

PS: In [my song](https://soundcloud.com/chromaticswing/a-summary-of-my-inability-to-let-go), I’ve hidden ***the licc*** inside somewhere, both in the crab canon immediately opening my song, & the canon-crab canon hybrid at 0:48. It might not use the exact notes we’re used to in minor, but it’s there. Hope someone can find it!",1673738858.0,Composers,11,1248,54,5965

107hyjj,Pads vs Keyboard dynamic accuracy.," Hi,

I have some weird and a bit annoying experience with my Maschine controller. I've tried different sensitivity settings, and I feel that pads sensitivity set to 90 and dynamic curve to Linear, or Hard 1 give me best results, but... it still sucks compared to keyboard midi controller.

Especially when I try to play percussion libraries, playing on keyboard feels just right, all the dynamic and feeling is there. When I start to lightly tap keyboard, and gradually increase the pressure, it will nicely and smoothly play it just like in real life (well, as for midi library ofc).

But when I play on pads on Maschine or Korg NanoPad it just feels wrong and all over the place. It lacks the smoothness of keyboard dynamic curve when keys are pressed. Very often when I push it slightly I get proper dynamic, but when gradually increase the pressure it just make weird spikes in dynamic, it just not smooth at all.

Playing keyboard and pads for comparison at the same time, the difference in accuracy is insane.

Maybe its ""pad thing"", or something else, but for my observations pads are far less accurate in dynamic curve than keyboard.

I’ve been using FL Studio for quite awhile now and I’m really looking to make a switch. I like FL however I’m moving towards a pop-rock / alt-rock direction (Weezer, Pixies, CSH, etc) and I’m looking for a better suited DAW for me to use for primarily tracking guitar, vocals, occasionally live drums but also being able to program drums and bass when needed.

Currently I’ve tried Reaper, Ableton, and Pro Tools. I’m honestly just not a fan of Reaper and Ableton’s workflow has been a bit too difficult for me to get my head around. 

I’m also trying to keep price in mind. I don’t have a very big budget so I generally prefer subscriptions however I also am trying to find the best balance of initial/monthly price and included plugins + plugins I may need to get. (Primarily autotune and a guitar cab). I am enjoying Pro Tools Studio however the included plugins seem a bit lacking and again I’m really not trying to spend too much if I don’t need to. 

Cubase Elements and Studio One’s subscription currently have me very interested, as Elements appears to include a great guitar amp sim and autotune, and Studio One also appears to have quite the selection.

I think the question boils down to do I….

1. Stick with PT, shell out a bit of money for more plugins

2. Cubase Elements 12

1075kr6,Audio peaking over time and in midi editor within Reaper,"So I've been using reaper as a metal musician to write, well, metal music. Overall, my experience with Reaper has been well. It's easy to use, the price is fair, and it's just overall a good software. 

Over time, however, I've noticed a few things that kind of bug me, and I'm looking for a way to solve them:

1. I use the GGD invasion pack for my midi drums, and I love them. However, I've noticed that the audio starts clipping when I open the midi editor while the song is playing. When I am not in the midi editor while my track is playing, this does not happen. 

2. Over time, the audio progressively starts to clip worse and worse for everything. I fix this by opening a new project (not just closing Reaper, I have to open or start a new project) and then going back to the previous one I was just working on. This cycle continues indefinitely. 

3. Not a huge concern at the moment because I can work around it, but my audio input is just ""quiet.""

106ro0t,First studio Mic - Neumann TLM102 vs Blue Baby Bottle SL?,"Hello everyone and Happy New Year!

I am about to open my first music studio and the only thing left for me to buy is the microphone; I was waiting until this point that I have tread acoustically the place and tried a couple of mics there (Warm Audio WA-47 and Shure SM7b).

I'd like to buy a condenser all-purpose (reggaeton, trap, hip-hop, ballads) -almost- microphone. (Recording acoustic guitar or miking up electric guitar amps would be great as well)

My 2 main options are the *Neumann TLM102* or the *Blue Baby Bottle SL*. I know, both microphones have a substantial difference in price, however that is not a problem.

I am leaning more towards the Neumann, since it is an industry standard and I know Neumann = quality; however, I have not tried it myself and some people say it lacks character and it's too flat or even too bright.

On the other hand, the Baby Bottle SL seems like an excellent option for the price, I have heard it previously on the studio and I was blown away by the quality, character and presence of the mic; kind of rumbly on the low end but nothing too serious, also the warmth the mic has is amazing.

As far as other options, I've eyed some other mics such as the Rode K2 and Warm Audio WA-47Jr, but I have yet to try them (don't think I can as of now, sadly).

Can I have some opinions on those mics to see what you guys think of them or even experiences with them? Also, extra suggestions would be much appreciated!

I'd always say to myself that I should just upload it and put it out in the universe, just for the fun of listening back and hearing my progress. Recently I purchased DistroKid in an impulsive moment where I would have the same thoughtprocess but replace soundcloud with Spotify in this case. Yet some friends, who have been making music longer than me, say that Spotify is a different league and all and that I should first build a following on Soundcloud before uploading to Spotify. 

In a way I understand this, because Spotify IS a different league (and in my opinion a more commonly used way for listening to music) so with my songs, probably not that professionally mixed,  I understand they would not do that well on Spotifiy in terms of getting a following. But on the other hand I'd like to apply the same thoughtprocess of thinking that it's just for me and the little following of around 30 people I have haha. If I go further I also would say that it's great for creating content, because using distrokid, I could use my music in insta stories, as sounds for tiktok yada yada.

What are your thoughts on this? Any experiences with this? Pro & cons? 

I was also thinking of maybe paying a mixing&mastering engineer to make the sound more professional?

Anyways, I finally got a Scarlett 2i2 and recorded a song with it, and I wanna make sure I do things as best I can here. I have a couple of specific  questions.

One: what's a good way  to re-amp if I don't have a good room for sound recording? I could  probably figure something out, I'm just having trouble thinking on my  own what that might be. My initial plan was to forgo the re-amping  entirely and just go with amp and cabinet sims, but if anyone knows a  good way to mic up an actual amp in less-than-ideal conditions and still  get an acceptable sound, I'm all ears.

Secondly,  does anyone have any tips on layering? I figure even if I re-amp, I'd  still layer with sims. But I'm also wondering about any good methods of  layering tracks if I choose not to re-amp. Most of my music is  instrumental, so the guitar is generally right up front, and everything  else is support, so I'm looking for good, heavy guitar tones that  command alot of attention but still sound realistic.

106jr4k,I think I FINALLY get why you use compression,"So for the longest time, I've known what a compressor does, but tbh I was pretty clueless about why you would actually use one, how it helps things sit in the mix, and how it can be used to maximize volume. 

For the longest time, I would put a compressor on something and while I could tell it was doing *something*, what exactly it was doing, I was kinda clueless about. 

Enter sound design and figuring out how to utilize volume envelopes to create transients. I started really being able to hear the transients in audio as I was designing them in certain sounds. 

Once I could actually make out what the transient of a sound sounded like, it was so much easier to hear compression working on something. I know transients aren't the only use for a compressor, but it's a big part of it, and being able to actually clearly hear when the compressor was in effect, really helped things to click for me.

I had always heard that compressors could be used to help things sit in the mix, but I honestly never knew why, tonight I finally had a breakthrough in that regard. I was mixing two horn sections together, one was in the higher frequencies playing a chord progression, and one was a lower burst of horns. When the burst of lower horns would come in, it would completely dominate the mix for the first second or so and the higher ones would briefly become very hard to hear, and it finally clicked for me: *the transient is that part that's making the other part hard to hear! If I use a compressor to smooth control that transient, I'll have the same effect with the sound and the same energy, but there will be enough headroom left over for the higher horns to shine through!*

It was a SERIOUS light bulb moment for me, it was like all of a sudden all of the use cases for compression came rushing in. Sounds that have alot of movement to them where they are fluctuating in volume, you can compress them so that you can clearly hear every part of it without having to jack the volume up possibly distorting or drowning out other sounds. 

It was like a cascade of ideas came to me, you can increase the overall loudness of a mix by applying a compressor to the whole, allowing things to reach their absolute max volume without having certain peaks distort or valleys become inaudible.

Is there any use cases I'm missing for compression? I feel like I'm feeling starting to get it, and it was one of those things I absolutely sucked at.",1673185946.0,Producers,9,501,45,2444

A friend of mine mentioned compatibility when it comes to M1 chips; I've looked around this and as far as I can tell it's just a case of finding plugins that support it/using work arounds for those that don't. 

I currently get student discount on the apple store (no longer a student in 3ish months, so I'd like to take advantage of this now); which means I also get all apple software for £179 (Logic pro, mainstage, final cut pro, compressor, and motion) which is an absolute steal as I'd like to get into video editing also.

So, does software compatibility change with the M1/M2 chips? and if not, are there are reasons why I should take an M2 besides the very slight performance increase?

Basically I can take an M1 with upgraded ram (16gb instead of 8GB) for £250 cheaper compared to the M2 with upgraded ram; which would be ideal, but am I going to regret not going for the M2 in the future/for any reason?

I'm in highschool and need to start looking at college but as far as I've seen music majors are audition based so I figured now is a good time to start learning but I just don't know where to start.

I have a keyboard that I can plug into my computer, Adobe software (I used to do a lot of editing so I still have a subscription) and a somewhat good quality mic so for a beginner I dont think equipment is gonna be an issue. 

how did some of you start out? what steps should I take to learn some skills while not having access to an actual class (and most likely not being able to afford an online one)?

1066b9g,Is this song plagiarized?,"First of all, I apologize if this is not the right sub for this question.

I heard the song ""Vieni nel mio cuore"" (released in 2022) by the Italian singer Ultimo, which immediately reminded me of The Wanted's ""Chasing the sun"" (released in 2012).

If you don't want to listen to both songs side by side, the most obvious parts are the choruses: [0:41](https://youtu.be/RFS5N_yAGTo?t=41), 1:48 & 2:39 in [Chasing The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFS5N_yAGTo) and [0:52](https://youtu.be/DoG5sIjFvHs?t=52), 1:47 & 2:23 in [Vieni nel mio cuore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoG5sIjFvHs).

And also the entire structure of Vieni nel mio cuore follows the structure of Chasing The Sun almost down to a T:

|The Wanted - Chasing The Sun|Ultimo - Vieni nel mio cuore||
|:-|:-|:-|
|0:00-0:26|0:05-0:32|Initial part|
|0:26-0:41|0:32-0:52|Buildup to the chorus|
|0:41-1:11|0:52-1:08|Chorus|
|1:11-1:26|1:08-1:27|Second part|
|1:26-1:41|1:27-1:47|Buildup to the chorus|
|1:48-2:03|1:47-2:02|Second chorus|
|2:03-2:19|2:02-2:23|Only part which could be considered a bit different, but still it is a buildup to the last chorus|
|2:19-2:39|2:02-2:23|In this part Ultimo's song is kind of a mix of this part and the 2:03-2:19 part of Chasing The Sun. It is a bit ""calmer"" like this part of Chasing The Sun, but it has lyrics.|
|2:39-3:11|2:23-2:56|Last chorus|

I'm not an expert in music, so I might be completely wrong, but to me, a layman, it seems way too obvious. The moment I heard the first few notes I remembered of The Wanted's song. Reading through the comments of the song, I wasn't the only one who noticed the resemblance.

Im wondering if everyone can throw in their recommendations for something that can come close to the precision of the shure se215.

My music is Modern orchestral(japanese animation style), so i really need to hear the clarity of the inner voices of the orchestra in a track, which is why the se215's have served me well. 

Im not sure how to judge the bass aspect, but the shure covers it well enough that im happy with what im hearing on them. the reverb doesnt overcrowd the noise, but its presence is enough for music that anchors itself on the bass.

105raix,"How to make a song sound more ""professional""?","Hey producers!

Im an absolute beginner when it comes to arranging and producing music but i wanted to give it a try because music has been the most important thing in my life for as long as i can remember.

Im playing drums and ukulele, but i have no clue when it comes to music theory, this is what i focus on as next.

I bought FL Studio and a MIDI-keyboard for around 140 bucks and just started doing some stuff.

Ive a very little experience in some aspects, because i played around with Music Maker when i was a kid and i did a few remixes and mashups of popular songs using Audacity for the past few years.

But all those projects were just ""taking some songs and tracks that already exist and play around"" instead of creating something from scratch, recording (MIDI) all instruments by myself, arrange them, mix them, choose effects and produce it.

I wanted to start on some oldschool hip hop beats, i took Mockingbird and Stan by Eminem as inspiration.

I recorded some tracks, lead and sub-melody, drums, a few basslines and harmonies. More or less trial and error and what i could figure out by trying and hearing due to lack of knowledge in music theory.

Im actually satisfied by what its now, i kinda like it. But it sounds.. raw. 

And this is where my question starts:

How do i make my songs sound like a real production instead of a toy-song?

After i got the track as itself, the next step would be mastering and working with effects, right?

Are there any tips or tricks, any common used workflows, mechanics, effects that i could use? 

I tried to use some volume automations to make it more ""fluid"" and to create a flow, but it didnt really work well.

Maybe you have an idea what to do next, most of you were at this point i guess, id love to learn from your experiences!

 I was pointed towards XO and Atlas 2 as alternatives , and I wanted to ask everyone how far has this tech gone recently? 
what plugins are at the cutting edge of being able to load up your own samples, and have a unique pattern generated?

Are there generators that can listen to a chord progression and generate a drum pattern to it using your own samples?  Are there plugins that can listen to a couple chords of a guitar and generate a bass line that actually works rhythmically and harmonically with the chord progression?  can I enter a chord progression like I-iv-V and have any instrument or drum pattern be auto generated?  will it read my mind? make fresh pots of coffee? Will it ruin the industry? what plug-in can I basically fart into and it will generate a more radio friendly fart and can adapt the fart to various popular and familiar but new rhythm and melody that I can then take large whiffs from inspirationally and take it from there?  When i produce large farts by myself, nobody seems to appreciate them like do. (some kind of “sounds like you need to buy a ‘butt plug-in’” joke would go well here)

1040cxb,Tips on muddy bass (tech house) ?,"So i've now spent days trying to get a clean and loud mastered export for a tech house track and I just can't figure out how to get my bass to sound nice and prominent but in harmony with the rest of the mix without it clipping or sounding heavely sidechained. I'm now 3 days into learning mastering and wondered if anyone has suggestions? I've tried turning up and down the bass in the mix. I've tried to turn the rest of the mix down and leave the bass. But everytime I export and go to master it it just sounds muddy af and just trash overall.

104034f,Arpeggiation techniques,"Hey, does anyone have any advice on how to get good arpegiation patterns, or similar to arpeggiation, im not sure what the correct name is, but its between an arpeggio and a melody, very common in EDM, I hope people no what I'm talking about. Its something I find isn't explained very often in tutorials and YouTube vids.

Notewise obviously octaves, fifths, thirds and minor 7ths are the main ones. 2nds add a lovely sound, in place of the third something to get an ambiguous harmony, 6ths give a nice bit of colour too

then rhythmically like a 3 over 4 pattern is always the go to for me (play 3 note pattern eg, C, E, G, C, E, G.... but in 4 beat rhythm, hope you get what I mean) but gets over used and I get bored of it pretty quick

Anyone got any little tricks they would like to share, or certain note combos, patterns and rhythms they use or if they've found any tutorials on the subject they could share.

here's one by Protoculture, using an arpeggiator but im not strictly talking about arpeggiators, also just manual making patterns in a piano or something

I've pitched corrected and automated volume on vocal track using melodyne. The vocals have a subtle double-track through most of the song.

The song doesn't sound as ""full"" as other music I've listened to on the same setup. I've also done mastering limiting/compression but it still sounds a little quiet despite having a little clipping here and there.

I'm having particular trouble with the vocals though. Firstly, in the chorus, I am full-on belting the notes out; there is a lot of natural distortion to my voice which doesn't seem to come through; it sounds like I've sung quietly and turned the volume up. The vocals also don't seem to sit well in the mix. Have tried more reverb, less reverb, and various EQ and compression combinations, but it doesn't really seem to help.

The vocals are compressed at 4:1 and have a boost at ~500Hz and ~4000Hz for fullness and clarity.",1672922210.0,Producers,22,199,90,1009

I honestly question whether I still like making music anymore, that feeling that I used to have where I would get excited with music feels gone. It’s a weird feeling, I was wondering if anyone else has felt like this and what have you done to surpass it.

I know a lot of people talk about sound selection and I don't think my samples are bad but it's just I don't think I know how I should be properly processing my kicks or how I should be layering properly \[all my inspos do it\]. 

For reference I'm super inspired by burial and I like to make similar stuff \[particularly his untrue stuff\] but I've noticed on that album and this goes for a lot of other music tbh the kicks aren't really THAT crazy or loud/low-end heavy it's just there establishing itself into the mix as a kick but when you view it as an average listener you aren't really looking for that, so I almost need to lower my barrier to entry with kick samples?? 

Maybe I just need somebody else's ear to tell me what they hear going on with some of my favorite drum sounds used in songs.

Here's the thing though, once I'm playing these songs that have been manually lowered to prevent audio spikes I notice I'm just cranking my volume up anyway to match with how loud other songs are. The balance of the song is off, for example I'll listen to my music in the car at volume level 40 but when I put on the songs that I lowered to make sure there's no audio spiking I'm cranking that song up anyway to 48-50 in order for it to sound just as loud as everything else it's incredibly annoying.

I feel like no matter what song I put into Magix Vegas I'm always getting the audio spike which makes me think I'm doing something wrong because surely every single song shouldn't be getting spikes? I was under the impression that you absolutely don't want red spiking audio but I feel like basically every song I have will spike if I put it into Magix Vegas yet I can tell you when I'm playing them they don't sound like there songs that would have spiked audio because wouldn't that mean it would start crackling or something?

This is a decision that's took a long time to come to after lots of half-quitting it to pursue something more ""stable"", a view I had internalized from modern society and family perspectives. This isn't just a passion, it's the service I want to offer most to the world. I'm tired of being caught between ""follow your passion = never work a day in your life"" and ""If you make your passion your job you will hate it"". Live to work VS work to live is another example. I know it's not going to be fun all the time or even most of the time but I'm tired of squandering my time trying to learn new skills that don't suit me at my core.

To clarify, I have a Bachelor of Arts in Music. We've been told a million times how difficult it is, I'm not here to argue that. I'm not aiming for fame or fortune, but to build a sustainable, consistent, small business that scales until I can live comfortably.

While I am open to other adjacent career paths within music, I am aiming to become a fulltime producer or audio engineer. I would love to be a full time performing artist, but it's unrealistic to my circumstances and I've made peace with doing that as a hobby. I've spent the last roughly 3 years dipping my toes into the basics of it but struggle to produce high quality sounds. Progress has been made for sure but its apparent I could have made better use of my time, something I'm looking to do now.

I could go on and on about this stuff, but I'm definitely lost in many areas so I'd like to get out of my shell and start asking people what to improve. I've consumed SO MUCH information from podcasts, videos, workshops, etc. but most of these are soft skills or practices that are too advanced for the stage I'm at. You can only sift through and watch so many ""decent"" YouTube videos, I'm sick of generic advice.

I then tried to use Audacity to actually record the signal but there i noticed a very strange behavior and thats why i am asking for help here.

Sometimes it does not show any signal beyond a tiny peak in the waveform but if i reconnect the input on the UCA222 it always gets the signal for a few seconds as it should and than drops back to no signal. Randomly it gets the signal again for some moments. I was not able to record more than seconds continuously.  See: [https://imgur.com/a/dBDUBZC](https://imgur.com/a/dBDUBZC)

(the second wave block was when i manually reconnected the input wires)

I tried a windows recording app where i observed the same behavior (so i dont blame audacity, cause that works for all my other devices). 

There is no loose connections or damaged wires as far as i could test.

Does anyone have an idea? Is the device broken or what could / should i try next?

We went on a few tours and a handful of festivals. I also met a few smaller artists and influencers that I did various sound engineering jobs for.

Anyone familiar with Soundtoys bundle, or their pluins in general? Wondering if it's worth it. I like a couple of their plugins but everything is on sale right now and I could get the whole bundle for $240.

Not that $240 is cheap, but if I got only the ones I like it would probably be between $120-180ish, and I'd only get 3-4 plugins. I figure for just the extra $60, I get all 21.

But, this is how you end up with a ton of unused plugins over time, isn't it? Cus there's almost always some kind of ""for an extra $50, I get 10 more!"" thing to snag you. And I really don't like getting into the buy for the sake of buying habit. It's costly and wasteful.

102nyoa,Figuring out how to optimize outsourcing work to studio musicians,"Hello,

I'm currently using FL Studio, writing songs with my keyboard via midi input. For instruments that I don't play, I'd love to get better quality recordings and thus find a studio musician to record the part. For instance if I had a midi harp playing, I'd like to get that recorded live and put that into the track instead. I'm trying to figure out what would be the best way to go about doing this?

Right now my current thought process would be to simply do what I am doing with FL Studio, then export the midi file to Muse Score. When I've tried this, the notation looks super messed up. But let's say I take some time to get it correct, then I can send this to a studio musician (I found a few websites to connect with these types of folks). They send a recording back, which I'd then put into the project, and then mix/edit to taste.

Is there anything that I could do to optimize this process? This seems a little clunky, or slow. It looks like Cubase has a notation editor built in. Would it be worth it to learn Cubase if this is something I plan on doing a fair amount? How do you guys do this sort of thing? Any tips/advice is appreciated.

* Samples: I use Dropbox for things like drum samples and custom-recorded sounds, but some libraries like NI Komplete are way too big.  I could throw those all on an external drive or two, but sometimes the path will get messed up (NI thinks the library is at /studio/external/library instead of /home-setup/external/library), and if I correct the library path then the next time I go to the other location it won't find the libraries again.
* Preferences (key commands, templates, default instruments): Are these things you just have to remember to manually sync, or is there a way to keep these up-to-date at all times? Even if there were a way to say, automatically copy all the files to the cloud (intelligently, meaning it only does so if it's the latest version) then that would help a lot.

102dzza,"Disentangling ""creative"" and ""generic"" song writing frustrations","So this may seem obvious to many of you, and probably more applies to those of you who aren't yet professional producers with the experience of building many successful tracks.

Something I have struggled with for many, many years is trying to write music that both ""sounds good"", ""fits a genre"", and satisfies my creative desires. I've always erred on the more chaotic/wild side of the production fence (as opposed to some meticulous producers who are more focused on perfectly mastering the sounds and techniques).


Almost always I'd find myself producing stuff that didn't work, because it was:

Too much raw creative intention that didn't ""make sense"" or ended up a clashing sound
or
Too generic sounding


My most recent realisation is that being generic and being creative are not opposed, rather you need to build a truely solid generic base, then apply creativity over the top/around this basis. An ideal jumping off point for creating is a tried and tested core.


Obviously if you inhabit a purely experimental space, this doesn't apply. If like me, you're trying to introduce new ideas to established genre spaces, the trick is not to avoid sounding generic. It's to make a generic idea and then apply new ideas within or between the generic foundation.


Conceivably you could start with the creative element (s) but I've found I simply get lost working this way and end up with a mess.



I guess the core of the idea is, separating ""good production"" from ""creative experimentation"", so that you're not trying to do two things at once. It also helps to anchor your wild fantasies in familiar tropes.

I hope this helps someone. For the first time in 15+ years of toying with music, I've started writing music I'm actually satisfied with, and actually finishing tracks rather than moving on from an 8-16 bar loop. All by pushing on with a generic sounding beat instead of tossing it out in frustration. As the creative parts come in, I will often revise generic elements to fit, but the framework is still there to hold everything together.",1672767227.0,Producers,11,407,64,2053

102cfzu,missing files on sd? (tascam portastudio dp-24sd),"  Yo!! Thanks for reading yall.  Pulled out my dp24sd for the first time in a while last night.  Mixed down an old song, went to export and couldnt find how? (Maybe its rust, idk), but then i just exported the tracks individually. Plugged into my laptop and then all of the folders were empty.  
  Not only are music and audio depot empty folders, but when i click instead of taking me to an empty folder it takes me to some broken link online?  This sd card should also have other songs on it from previous exports. But theres nothing. 
  The songs are all still on the sd, because i can access them from the tascam. I'm worried there's something wrong that's real bad though.  This is the exact same cable, computer and console i have been using forever (just not in a while)

  Am i just rusty and I'm missing something really obvious and dumb?  Is it corrupted?  

Anybody else ever experience this?? Plz help!

Thanks yall.",1672763486.0,Producers,10,199,49,928
102c409,Music visualiser,"Hi, 

I have currently been working on developing a music visualiser application which can hopefully morph and change colour based on volume, stereo signal and key/notes. 

I feel like it could be useful for independent music artists wanting to release videos for their music on YouTube or Instagram and hopefully it can make them more interesting.

101wy1r,Need some help choosing free music program software,"My sister likes to sing and record it, does karaoke type stuff where she sings music with a mike and background music (voices taken out).    
I just set her up with a older dell PC laptop (all she could afford) and the only input is headphones.  She would like to be able to record on this laptop... and she has the following specifications.  


*""I need something external to plug my mic into, my earphones into, music thru(or whatever) and a program that has multiple channels, record and edit, simple auto tune, fx and reverb, frequency controls, can turn music into karaoke(take the voices out and leave just the music). You know, recording for dummies.""*  


So from what I gather from that is she needs something she can plug headphones, with mic into that will allow her comp to record to software with multiple channels (Im guessing stuff like main vocals, backup vocals) and then put it all together.  As the laptop has no inputs, there will probably need to be some sort of external device to USB to plug into.

\-have produced an interesting piece of work recently.

Some examples of what I’m going for is the into to bon voyage by Droeloe or the intro to leaving by Ekali.

A pure sine wave gets something similar but never sounds quite as smooth. I’ve tried using a more distorted sine wave like the analog bd sine wavetable in serum which adds some more character but still isn’t it.

I’m think the spacing of notes might be playing a part here? Like if I play a normal triad the chord sounds a little too full. 

What are you tips for making pleasant simple sine wave chords?



Edit: So i achieved what i was trying to do by doing this:

Sine wave, Slight FM with subtle attack envelope. LP filter, subtle chorus, EQ, tiny compression, transient shaper to add a little attack back, EQ. Most importantly the chord voicing is ~2 octaves apart with 3 notes. Sounds hardly any different w/o the compression/shaper tbh. I also have a macro adding in another sine wave 1 oct higher which sounds nice when its quiet. Thanks for the tips.",1672584324.0,Producers,8,240,38,1116

I feel like I can make songs but i can never make a full song start to finish. It’s not impossible but garageband doesn’t seem good for learning how to make music, or anything other than just learning how DAWs work.

The only thing I could think of is that there aren’t enough loops that you can use to make a intro, verse, chorus, and outro with. For example if you just try to make a song with loops with one category selected (like house) you can probably make a chorus but not build up to it really using said selected category only. I can do this on logic pro i feel like.

I also feel like some of the instruments sound more like soundfonts than midi instruments. Like the hard rock guitar is just too intense to sound at least a little natrual

Other than that I can’t quite put my finger on it

I was trying to program some drums to the song “Deceived” by Trivium. I was using Logic Pro but found it extremely difficult to use the piano roll for this purpose. To avoid having to input the all the notes by hand, I played in the notes I could and then was going to quantize and edit the remaining notes. This sounds good in theory but logic wasn’t accurately recording the midi from my kit and placing each note by hand is tedious while trying to remember exactly how the drum parts go. The kit I’m using is the Alesis Strike pro SE.

zz86bw,How to make metal drums less repetitive?,"I'm a one-person musician currently making a black metal project. I'm still a beginner with little equipment, so aside from my electric guitar and my voice, I have to program everything using a DAW. I only have one song out so far that I made with Bandcamp (lame, I know), but I've been familiarizing myself with Reaper. It's been a huge learning curve, but I love it so far.

I've got a track with drums (PerfectDrums VST plugin) and a mediocre bassline (SiBass VST plugin I think), both of which I used a virtual MIDI editor for. It's very tedious to do so but I'm actually quite proud of my drums, especially as a beginner. My issue is, I feel that it's very repetitive. I hope I can explain it properly, but it goes:

Intro + Blast Beat 1 + Blast Beat 1 + Blast Beat 2 + Blast Beat 2 + BB1 + BB1 + Tom-Snare Roll + Tom-Snare Roll + BB1 + BB1 + Kick/Cymbals Beat + K/C B + BB1 + BB1 + Roll + Roll

I think it's decent but that lasts about 20 seconds, and then I just repeat it over and over for the next, like, 2 minutes. Does anyone have any tips on what I should add or how I can prevent myself from making repetitive drum beats in the future, especially since the genre of music I'm making is very reliant on having exciting drums?

EDIT: I also want to encompass different subgenres in my project (such as industrial, shoegaze, new-wave, etc.) but with the main focus being black metal, so I'm a little unsure about how to do that. ",1672426156.0,Producers,8,327,40,1439

I'm trying to sidechain a bass to my kick and following this video as a guide (at around 12:18) [https://youtu.be/70neJH5OELk?t=738](https://youtu.be/70neJH5OELk?t=738)

Here's a video really breaking down what's going on for me. I've even tried moving the sidechain trigger even further in front of the kick and upping the attack on the compressor just a bit in case that was making a distorted noise or something, and got varied results from that.

But you would think it shouldn't be this hard to navigate this, and I'm using the exact same compressor and settings as this video. Is this a logic thing? Is it just an unavoidable click that the compressor is causing this synth that causes it to spike? Plugin latency stuff? (I have plugin latency compensation on)

Am I missing something super obvious? Thanks for your help.

Is mixing in 'proper' terms just a myth? I find that whenever I go to mix properly, as in, mixing session where I strip and do all the right things like remove clipping etc, that my songs just become so much less. Sometimes I watch famous producers spend 30 minutes dialling in a reverb, but to me, these processes happen during production whimsically, emotionally... I mean of course, my music is not all clipping and has really fantastic dynamics (in my mind), but its just when I try to domesticate the song it sorta loses its life...

2-Then I bus each track separately or by pairs to two auxes (L&R) and low cut and hi-cut them until I find the frequencies where the crispiness resides.  
3-I apply Decapitator to the auxes, I crank the Drive fairly high and adjust with the mix button until it's basically just noticeable.

zxzqi4,Help me choose a MIDI controller,"TL,DR:

Budget: 100$

Size: 25 - 36 Keys

DAW I'm using: FL Studio

Preferences: heavy weight, its not going outside my house. DAW controls (play, pause, record, etc.). and preferably full size keys, although, I don’t mind.

Looked at: Akai MPK Mini mark 3, Arturia MiniLab 3, Nektar Impact LX25+


Notes: i heard the MPK Mini has build quality issues and is very light weight (which is not what I'm looking for) compared to the Arturia MiniLab.
I don't know about the Nektar Impact.


Hello. I've been producing music for the past 5 years. All these years i did it on my laptop and i played using the keyboard. I find it really fun making beats, although i do it just for myself, i don't upload them.

Now, i want to get better at it, and invest a little bit in it. Not too much, i still do it just for fun, but i think after all this time there's no going back hehe.

I'm using FL studio and i want something small, 25 keys or it can be a lil bit bigger, i don't mind.
I have 100$ to spend on it.

It doesn't have to be light weight, infact i prefer that it won't because it won't be going outside my house. I looked at the Akai MPK MINI but i heard it's not as well build as the Arturia MiniLab 3.",1672300912.0,Producers,6,295,32,1200

My main instrument is guitar, but I can play bass well enough and some basic drums and piano. I have a 25 key MIDI controller, and this is how I've been adding drums to my tracks. However, I'm thinking of investing in two things: a full-scale MIDI keyboard, and an electronic drum kit. I do not plan to gig on drums or piano, so them being useful for practice or not is not an issue. I just want to know if these are worthwhile purchases for production, and if you have any recommendations for which to get of each? Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Logic behind downvotes on Reddit is a mystery to me, but whatever... thanks for the advice, the three people that commented. I may decide on some drums later, but for now, I have purchased a Yamaha PRS-E473, which is a nice affordable 61-key model. The extra low and extra high octaves are probably not needed.

zxvj8z,Do you have similar experience as me? (Collaborating with a business person dilemma),"I'd like to share my experience collaborating with a guy and hear what you guys think about it. I'd be just my complains and sound childish, so I apologize in advance. 

I'm an amateur music producer doing songwriting, arrangements, mixing and mastering. I've been making music with the guy who is a 38 year old man and used to play in the band. He gave up his dream to be a professional musician when he is 20's, now working in other field not related to music and pretty rich.

Luckily, he admires me and always cheers me like ""you can be a pro in the future, you are so talented. Keep it up!"". I appreciate his cheers. And in this year, he asked me to produce a song together. He can't do anything about music but making a melody. So he said he'll make a melody, music marketing and pay me and a singer who I hired for the cost (he has the budget though, enough for me), and asked me to do all other sings like checking his melody, make the construction of the song, arrangement, mixing, mastering and managing the vocal production with singers I hired. 

I was excited at this project because I can do more things I can't do myself, especially hiring a vocalist. Although, making several songs together, I was staring to his attitude to music. Honestly, his melody is usually messy that I can't make any ideas of arrangement and get proceeded to the next process. So I gave some feedback to him like ""you can make this note to this, it'll be better and memorable because of the music theory like this"". He said ""OK I'll try. I'll make some melodies so please pick up the melody you'd like"". But his melodies he sent to me didn't get improved even several months has passed and always sounds ""just made without thinking anything"". Honestly I 'd like him to ""try"" to make a better melody at least even if it's a bit of growth and takes more time, because I'd like to make good music with him. I know everyone has a different music experience and getting better skills always taking much much much time. So I'm happy if the person collaborating with is trying to learn and practice at least. I don't care about how high their skills to collaborate, but their attitude and enthusiastic to music.

He always say ""I wanna get the grammy"", ""everyone looks me down when I say I wanna get the grammy. But I believe I can make the dream come true as long as I say"". Although, unfortunately, his stance is still always like ""please pick up the melody you like"", ""I don't know about music theory or anything of details about music like you, so I can't do it"", ""I don't wanna take a time to learn and google about music"" or other things sounds like he don't keen on music. So it was like a music lesson that always gives him a lot feedback and modify his melodies to make them decent as a song. Sometimes he gave feedback to my arrangement and mixing though, his opinions is too ambiguous said ""I know I'm irresponsible and don't know what to do but you can do more"". As a producer, I asked some questions to clarify what he is thinking and find what to do. He didn't answer anything and I was thinking it's my fault, lack of my professional skills. Some of my friends said it's because he doesn't any vision for music, like what kind of music he wants to make, what's his music style, what his favorite music style, but just wants to get more ""numbers"" like views, streams, and money. Honestly I think they are probably right. Because he always say ""I'd like to make money with music"", ""I wanna provide a song to artists all over the world"", but I haven't heard any ideas that makes the song better and his strong feelings about music.

When the release date of the song was coming, I asked him about the music marketing like does he have any plans what service you'd plan to use to publish the song, what service for music marketing because he said he'll do anything about the marketing with his skills of marketing, which he is working in his full time job. But he didn't search anything at the time. He didn't even know the platform like Tune Core and Distrokid. Even he asked me ""how can we publish a song?"".

If he is just a marketer and don't make music, watching just the numbers is completely fine because their job is to make money and get more view or streams. Although I feel what he said is unrealistic for his efforts to make music and he doesn't seem not genuine to music. I'm sad that he thinks music just as the tool to make money and give him desire to feel ""I succeeded as a musician"". One day he said ""The Beatles and Michael Jackson did succeed just with their feeling. They are just lucky because they didn't have to practice hardly with their natural talent"". I got mad at what he said and my friends who I told about him did too. I don't know but he often excuse why he doesn't practice or think deeply about music by saying ""I'm already an old man so can't do things like young people"", ""I don't have any talent"" and ""I don't have enough music experience as other musician to succeed"".

What I feel sad and frustrated are that I don't have enough skills to be hired by someone and I can't hire people and buy things for music production without support from the guy. I understand it's my lack of my skills so I need to practice and learn more. And I appreciate him that he admires me and pay me for music production at least. Although just feel so sad that I haven't met people who keen on music so much and try to make our song better (and the best) together. 

I'm always wondering am I wrong, too picky and just hard to people. Complaining it here like this is so lame of me to begin with though...I'd like to ask what you think about my situation and if you have a similar experience as me. I'd be grateful if you'd be how you solve such situation.

Thank you for reading this until the very end even though it's too long. I'm too emotional these days. I'll get back to my learning of music production now to go to the next stage.",1672287747.0,Producers,16,1322,84,5950

I have been recording demos of my songs and putting them on SoundCloud for years. I have had people tell me many times that if my music was on Spotify, they would put them in playlists, share them, listen to them while sleeping, etc. The thing is, I know very little about recording and producing and have done everything on my own with free virtual tools.

I myself don't tend to listen to songs that aren't on spotify, so I feel it would be the best way to get my music more listens. However, I have never really intended for any of my recordings to be what I would consider quality enough to have them be official releases, even though I am going for more of a bedroom, lofi genre.

Recently I have been looking into groove boxes. Which is like ok that’s cool, however I am a bit confused I haven’t seen a lot of use of other music genres. Which honestly I expect a lot of the groove boxy type things are catering to the hip hop and edm crowd. However I am looking for a device that would allow me to try and do something different in terms of genere and I guess I have some thoughts on how to do that. One would be to use a sequencer kind of groove box to kind of sketch out the back track of the song and later import into a DAW and fully produce and polish the rest. However I do se ways I could maybe use the sampler type work flow as well to build up some of the other pieces of music. Now here’s where it gets really confusing to me I see that the novation circuit devices (tracks and rhythm) are really bang for your buck type of machines however I have heard that their integration into daws isn’t so good so they would just be really a sketch pad. So my question is what should I do should I get one or the other, or both? Or should I look at something different?

zxezg2,How to deal with meticulous perfectionism in musical project management? I keep running in circles,"I’m a jazz/instrumental composer (and attempted producer), and I’ve been working on eleven tracks for the past three years. I’m an obsessive perfectionist, and find myself very unwilling to release my music until it is perfect or very close to perfect. I’m finding myself constantly changing my mind with regards to who should perform the music, who should mix and master, and other things.

I wanted to hire freelance session musicians from online to play on my tracks, so that they’d have more of a human feel than the VIs. However, I’ve learned that Fiverr is not the best option for me, as the vast majority of the (15+) orders I’ve made have come back unsatisfactorily. This generally boils down to performers not playing with the expressive touch and phrasing I have in mind, playing rigidly and robotically even when reference material (piano recordings I made to indicate dynamics, supplementary to the sheet music I write) is provided. Sometimes, though, the performers are outright unable to perform the music correctly at all, but accept the money anyways. On a handful of occasions, I’ve paid people only to have them submit recordings that sound wholly unpracticed.

I then circled back to focusing primarily on VIs, resolving that it’s unlikely that human freelancers will be able to pick up on the nuances of my musical visions through asynchronous recording sessions organized through a budget freelancing site. In a large number of cases, these do the job well. I’ve had people tell me that they sound indistinguishable from proper recordings (particularly my bass, drums, and orchestra sections). However, there are a handful of instruments, such as saxophones, for which there don’t seem to be any satisfactorily lifelike software emulations. SWAM saxophones just aren’t there yet, IMO. So, at the very least, I need one or more human saxophonists.

Searching for human saxophonists led me to continue searching for other instrumentalists, as well. I do not think I need to hire a trumpeter because good ones are extremely out-of-budget and okay ones likely won’t provide anything usable (my music often wanders into the extreme upper range of the instrument). I’ve received quotes for human performances of almost every track on my album, and, on SoundBetter, the average price per recording hovers around $250. I’m a college student on a limited budget; I just can’t do that to my bank account.

I want to produce professional-quality music, and I think that I’m working healthily towards that point in my composition and arrangement, but in terms of production and project management, I’ve been wandering in circles, throwing money at the walls in hopes of a miracle for three years. This album has turned into a spending problem, which may soon tangibly affect my life. One of my chief life goals is to be a successful and renowned jazz creator, but in terms of releasing an actual product I’m proud of, I’m lost. And that’s not even touching on mixing and mastering.


TLDR: I keep changing my mind between getting online freelancers to record my music and having virtual instruments play it, and I’ve wasted a lot of money and time in the process.",1672247493.0,Producers,16,642,98,3172
zxeysx,Need help with Mastering!,"Hi all

2023 is going to be the year I release some music.  I have plenty of tracks ready to go - with 4 in mind as the first release.  I am not able to master effectively using Reason 12 - I do love the DAW and have been using it since version 2.5 - but it's not cutting it on the mastering end.

I am looking to buy oZone when I can afford it, as I've heard great things about the software and the presets.  I was hoping one of you kind people would put a couple of tracks through a couple of the presets to (a) let me hear what it sounds like and if it is worth the investments and (b) hopefully having a better mix than currently, ready for when I unleash the tracks on the world.  

I wish I could pay the going rate but it's just not possible at the moment.  I could pay a little or make a charitable donation, if that would go some ways to convincing you to have a go at helping a brother out.

I shall leave this in the hope that someone can help.

The instrumentals are just one single wav file, so I’m unable to mix each instrument/track individually so it all comes together, so my question is: How exactly should I go mixing the vocal synth and a single audio file already pre-mixed?

What about harmonised leads? Would you double track both parts, left and right, thus end up with 4 guitar parts?

zx7u8l,Human races & music preference,"I'll try to be as cautious as possible here because there's no hint of judgement or prejudice on my part. I'm just trying to satisfy my curiosity and I'm hoping for civilised discussion :)

(As a white person) I can't help but notice that Black people aren't equally represented in all music - they disproportionally feature in music genres like blues, jazz & sould but are few and far between in rock, metal or normal, i.e. non-soul influenced pop. Similarly, you can rarely see Black people in contemporary classical or orchestral music. Even in strictly electronic music they're very present in techno or drum & bass genres, but almost absent in stuff like trance or EDM/IDM.

Why is that? Partially I'm sure it's cultura and social reasons - blues & jazz originated from and are considered ""Black"" music, whereas mostly european orchestral music is ""foreign"" to most Black people. But what explains electronic music disparities? Or rock / metal one?

It's hardly controversial - I hope? - that Black people are better dancers, so could some of it at least be attributed to different way they feel the rhythm & groove? That would explain preference for techno vs. very rigid trance, or jazz / funk vs. mostly simplistic rock / metal.

At the same time I concede that I might simply be mistaken, driven by stereotypes and cliches and it's all in my head.

Ok, so this makes it sound like a music producer is an individual who is generally in charge of both creative and technical aspects of making music records and projects... However, I will hear people say things like ""I would rather spend more effort composing good music than spend more time producing mediocre compositions,"" ""You cannot outproduce a poorly composed track"", etc... So, does production include or does it not include composition? Furthermore, does it or does it not include mixing, sound design, etc???

Also i don't make any mentionable money atm, i make like 200 bucks a month from something i enjoy doing.

I've not been producing music for too long, (two years) but i know that's what i want since it gives me an immense sense of peace and purpose.

I know, making money off of my own music is gonna be hard as fuck, and tbh there's a pretty good chance i won't make it. But i want to at least stay in the industry so i keep learning and adding to my own musical understanding. So i came here to ask you guys on how to best start making money with my skills.

How did you start to get paid? My production skills aren't professional yet, but solid. So are my songwriting / recording skills. I also do a weekly course right now which ends up with a diploma that's called ""Certified Music Producer"".

There's not a lot of studios in my area, and I doubt they'd hire me with the skills i have so far. There's also zero job offers to begin with in that industry. 

So firstly: How do i find jobs in that area and how do i make them want me as a ""trainee""?

And secondly: What can i do in terms of freelancing / self-employment and what's the best way to do it? (writing lyrics / mixing for other people on the side)

zwjmut,please help with workaround for Tascam Model 16,"I just purchased a Model 16 after researching audio interfaces for my home studio.

In deciding which interface to get ,  aux sends and returns were high on my list -as well as being able to simultaneously record tracks because I use specific outboard effects to dub out my music as a perform it live ( and with midi sequences).Unfortunately,  even though I thought I had be thorough in my research, it turns out I was not. Unlike every other fairly well appointed mixing console I have used before, it seems the 16 has aux sends but lacks aux returns. This is disappointing but I'm wondering if anyone can help me with a work a around. 

My biggest stumbling block is that I would like to track multiple instruments at once and perform dubbed effects in real time in varying combinations. 

Of course, I could use one, or two, of the normal channels as a return but I fear that track turning into a gobble gook of all my effects from multiple instruments- kind of defeats the purpose of individual tracking and mixing. Meaning, I wouldn't be able to do much mixing after I recorded.

I could also use a Mackie mixing board I have that does have aux returns ( and inserts for 8 of the channels) and some how try to side step the issue. I haven't completely thought this idea thru because I think it would probably add a bunch of unwanted line noise, be cumbersome spatially and I'm not sure if I can send the aux effects individually with the inserts anyway ( in previous experimentation, I believe the inserts WILL send the track individually by using the tip, but I think it's pre- aux return). 


Before I start to rethink the way I build my songs ( and my purpose on earth), can anyone pull a helpful idea out their hat?

zweksz,Highly recommend listening to ‘Tape Notes’ podcast to learn how top artists approach making and recording music - I’ve found it so inspiring!,"This podcast is unbelievable and has changed how I look at creating music. It’s presented by John Kennedy, a highly regarded radio presenter in the UK who really knows his stuff - He sits down with top artists from all sorts of genres and they break down the creative and recording process for their most recent album.

They typically start by showing the demo of a track and then talk about it’s evolution whilst going through the individual stem tracks that ended up on the final album. Throughout the episodes they talk about their philosophy towards music making.

I’ve learned so much from the four episodes I’ve listened to. Here are a few key points from episodes I’ve listened to so far:


[King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - KG & LW](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WFe47tl9VlWuS36e7vdeZ?si=Bc17eTU9RCuZ4qR7FvFrmQ)

- Some of Stu’s demos are unbelievably sketchy and rough, and he doesn’t consider himself to be a great recording engineer. He prioritises speed. On one track they had a quickly recorded demo, EQd drums and then just overdubbed guitars.

- Record 2 takes of the drums with a mono overhead. Kick in the middle and then hard pan the 2 takes to get that signature King Giz live drum sound.

- They use a lot of stock midi instruments (e.g. flute, clav) that sound rubbish soloed but in the context of the mix add that extra sauce.


[Foals - Life is Yours](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4NL91DFEsNQNRYeFaXZTrc?si=N6-l1dnwTKO-WSWUWXVZww)

- A lot of talk about writing with little to no effects to make sure it was a great song.

- When they then jam with effects, they come up with a million ideas and unique sounds they want to use. Their producer would then set parameters and allow them to use a different weird effect for a  bar or two so it didn’t overwhelm and detract from the song.

- The sheer amount of vocal harmonies and doubling they use blew my mind - adds so much to the massive sound they get but I’d never really noticed it. This has completely changed the way I look at vocals.


[Jon Hopkins - Music for Psychedelic Therapy](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7u1zmrj96zZYG1CSLD3IZj?si=v7E8f9B3T8-2PE-nY3aMUg)

- Trust your intuition. Most of the time the first thing he thinks of ends up in the song. Talks a lot about serendipitous moments such as when he accidentally hit his beer glass that was in the key of the song.

- Uses space as an instrument. He’d send stems to his mate who’d then blast it out of some jbl speakers in a forest, record it and send it back.

- Combining 3 or more sounds to create one cohesive element. E.g. a piano pedal for transient, a mid heavy synth and a high synth. Also creates weird percussive elements by waving some kind of sheet. Each of his tracks soloed could be an ambient song on their own - he’s too good!


[Caribou - Suddenly](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WFe47tl9VlWuS36e7vdeZ?si=cQvaDiiWR4Gbg2fzYC2K7w)

- Probably my favourite episode as Dan Snaith is just such a nice guy. Doesn’t consider himself a good vocalist but knows his strengths. Recorded a demo vocal and piano track for ‘Magpie’ and then sped it up slightly to give it a higher pitched ethereal feel - so cool!

- Early in his career he wouldn’t sing lyrics, just gibberish and this would often end up on the record. He’s moved away from this but a lot of his demos use this technique to find the melody.

- Interesting relationship with equipment. He mainly uses plugins but for this album used Floating points’ studio and synths to add extra sauce. A really interesting point was playing the melody on ‘Like I loved you’ with a midi guitar plugin and occasionally doubling it with a real guitar - sounds so cool! He also ditched his outboard eq and preamp because he can get the sounds he wants in plug-ins.

- Timbaland’s idea of introducing a cool new element at the end of a song that then leaves the listener wanting more.


The common thread between them all is simple - they do what they enjoy, set loose rules / concepts for the overall sound and experiment a lot - I found it really inspiring to hear that most of the time they don’t really know what they’re doing, they just mess around and enjoy themselves!

zwbywj,Can someone help me fix or add on to my song?,"Okay so I’ve been writing lyrics and making my own songs for a little over 10 years now. It started with just finding instrumentals on youtube and I write lyrics to them and record it. Three years ago I started playing guitar and I wanted to venture into writing my own songs on guitar I’ve made one two years ago but it’s not advanced at all, It’s just three chords for the entirety of the song. What I usually do is I just strum random things and come up with little riffs and try to build off of it. I found this beautiful melody and I cannot build off of it for the life of me. I believe the issue is because I came up with a melody so there isn’t really going anywhere with it because if I add any extra notes it changes the melody and sounds like a different song or changes the tempo which again sounds like a different song. I never play to a metronome and I know I should because trying to find the tempo of this melody is hard because I noticed it doesn’t that two notes are off beat but without them it doesn’t sound right. I tried making it a lead but with those two off beat notes it doesn’t line up with the second guitar. I’m new to writing my own songs on guitar so if anyone can help me whether it be to give me tips on what to do or message me and give me some ideas what I could to add to it and push me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated.",1672134394.0,Producers,12,307,45,1380

zw5l2r,Can't figure out what the point of a volume envelope is? read this?,"So I'm getting into sound design, and one thing that really baffled me was envelopes and their role in designing sound. I knew, technically, what they did, but as far as applying it to sound design in any meaningful way, I was kind of clueless. 

Here's the best way I think I can describe it. With an envelope, you are using these 4 parameters to literally shape the waveform. You've seen a waveform in your daw right? Maybe you've seen a kick drum. In a kick drum, if you look at the waveform, it starts it with an almost instant burst of volume, then ramps down and ends. With an envelope, that's what you're making, your designing what's called the transient, and then your designing what happens AFTER the transient happens. The attack is going to be the first part of your transient, it's how quickly the sound bursts in and reaches its maximum volume. For an 808, you would want a relatively quick attack, because you want the sound to smack really fast. 

The next knob is the decay, for a long time I was really confused between release and decay, I couldn't figure out the difference. The decay is how quickly the sound is going to decrease down to the sustain volume. So for an 808, you would have a relatively quick decay, because you want that quick burst of sound, you don't want it to stay at max volume for too long. You want that quick burst of sound, then for the bass to play. 

The sustain is how loud the volume is going to be after the attach and decay has gone by. When we are shaping sound, it's very valuable to be able to have something play at a lower volume than the initial transient, for an 808, we want a loud initial transient, then a lower volume for the actual bass sound. So we would turn the sustain like maybe halfway or 2/3 of the way down. Remember, the sustain is going to be related to the master volume of your patch, so it doesn't mean that turning the sustain down is going to create a weak sound. It's just how you shape the sound.

The release is how quickly the sound is going to fade to zero after the key is released. For an 808, the release time can really depend on your preference.

To get the hang of this, get a waveform out, and pay attention to what the transient looks like, see if you can identify what that sound would look like as an envelope, because you are essentially shaping the waveform with the envelope, so learning what different waveforms look like can really help you in dialing in the right envelope for the sound you're going for.

I hope this helps somebody.",1672112273.0,Producers,16,542,67,2532

It reads as if it puts a hold on the full amount and that can't be spent, dispite it not being a charge. Which seems pointless because then why bother with the monthly payment aspect of it.

I'm just confused with how it works and am wondering if anyone has any experience using that payment method and can explain it.

* Great-feeling keys. Fully-weighted piano-action keys preferred, but semi-weighted keys that feel fantastic to a pianist are ok as well. (Nothing that feels mushy or springy.)
* High-quality hardware - everything needs to feel solid and durable
* MIDI-assignable controllers - in addition to the standard pitch bend and mod wheel, I'd love a few extra controllers such as a 2nd mod wheel, touch-sensitive ribbon controller, X-Y pad or joystick. I don't need a ton of drum pads, faders, rotary knobs... I don't find those particularly useful. Something that can gracefully add continuous controller data (with my left hand as I'm playing with my right) is what I'm after.

Anyone here who knows how to recreate the synth in Oklou's absolute masterpiece ""Fall""?  
I remember watching an Instagram video of her showing that she simply used an Alchemy (Logic Pro) preset called ""Aqua Motif"" for her song ""God's Chariot"" which is also from the same album(Galore) as ""Fall"". So my guess could be that she has also based the synth for ""fall"" on the plug-in Alchemy?

I have a huge opportunity in Korea in January and I really need to learn at least the basics of writing chord progressions before I leave.

While I don't know how to play the piano, I am definitely not a beginner producer nor do I not know how to write basic chord progressions by ear. Here is an example of something complex i've created by ear if you go to :44 :

zv4c14,Plugin for visualization of frequency-panning space throughout the track,"First of all, I'm pretty new to all of this, so tell me if the question makes no sense and there's a better way to do it. A lot of videos about mixing show a visual representation of a song (frequency-panning space) and tell you how you should put different instruments in different places inside that space so that you would have a clean and wide mix. Problem that I have is that I usually have too many instruments throughout the mix and it becomes hard to keep track of when trying to clean it up and put every instrument in its own place. Is there a plugin that shows you how that frequency-panning space is filled so that I can for an example: see that I have too much empty space during verse 1 in  10 - 12 kHz on the left speaker and fill that with ambience, or more importantly: see that I have too many sounds that occupy 14 -16 kHz on the right speaker and maybe pan one of them more to the left. I understand that you should be able to do that just by listening, but if there is a plugin for visualization it would help me a lot. Also, I'm using Fl studio so if there already exists something for that inside it, you can also let me know. Thanks!",1671995255.0,Producers,9,247,72,1157

zuzrue,Versatile DAW for me?,"Hello!

I'm a guitar, bass and keys player who doesn't have much luck with bands. I decided to make some music on my own. Currently using Reaper, but I'm looking for something more versatile with nice built-in instruments and effects. Don't get me wrong - Reaper is great, but it doesn't come with any instruments, and effects are ugly and not inspiring. It has a reputation of being great to work with audio, but not so much with midi 

My main styles are rock, funk mixed with some synths. But I'd also like to try composing/scoring fir a film. Like orchestral stuff.

I also tried Ableton because I like the idea of looping my guitars on the fly, but to me it didn't feel right for a main studio DAW. It wasn't very comprehensible after Reaper. I got Launchpad mini, but any other Daws are good for live looping real instruments?

Another feature that I'd like to have is nice chords/harmony tools. I saw Cubase has nice features like audio chord detection, chord pads etc. I know intermediate music theory, but these tools seem to be great for reharmonizing and giving different taste to your song.

I have to say that I'm still working on improving my timing, so audio quantized would be nice to have.

Apart from that, goof sounding effects and maybe instruments. I don't care about guitar amp VSTs because I use Line6 Helix, but I think I need decent FX for mixing, mastering and maybe instruments. I do not need huge samples Library. Maybe only drum beats.

Also need something like pitch correction.

I love looks of Reason, but many people say that it lacks many features. On the other hand, everyone talks about lack of support for VST3, but not many other drawbacks are mentioned.

Cubase and Studio one seem to be really feature rich, versatile and suitable. 

Mixraft is not very popular, but on paper looks great. It has performance panel, seem to sound OK on YT videos, has built in Melodyne, it has all features for audio editing top I guess and works nice with MIDI as they say.

There's also Bitwig but don't know much about it. Also not much about Cakewalk, but it's free and has all the features of Sonar Pro as I heard!

What would you recommend? I would like to try two, max three Daws, master it and make music. I don't really want to waste too much time for trying and learning software. Would like to choose the one that works best for me.

I’ve been going absolutely insane trying to figure this out.

While i’m in the process of recording on my midi, everything sounds great and is on beat. But upon playback, everything is completely off time. Im definitely not imagining it, and it doesn’t have to do with me playing badly, as i even recorded a voice memo on my phone picking up the track WHILE i’m playing vs when i play back the recording, and it sounds wildly different.

im on low latency mode, adjusted recording to delay to match my buffer size, and even tried switching MIDI Controllers (I usually use a Nektar 88 key, but went back to my little 2-octave AKAI and it has the same issue).

Is this just a matter of needing a new computer at this point?


Additionally (a less pressing concern, but still) the synths themselves sound a bit different too during playback vs recording (i know oscillators are supposed to randomize to give an organic sound each time, but it sounds quite worse and less rich— quite noticeably so on things like 808 bass).

I don't have any listeners to speak of so I've never really given any thought to mastering my songs after mixing and bouncing save for throwing a compressor on the master channel but recently I've seen these automated mastering solutions online.  


I've seen a lot of discussion from producers and engineers about how AI and presets will never replace a mastering engineer I agree but I wonder for folks like me are these products good enough? I would never pay for a mastering service because I don't really see enough return on my money or time, plus I'm not really interested in the process.  So  my question is I guess, will running my completed track through one of these services improve my end product to some degree to make the expense worth it? 

If anyone here uses software presets or online mastering tools I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations",1671810339.0,Producers,7,190,47,996

Im baffled by this song, is sounds so majestic and mystical. 

The intro sounds so fucking huge and im wondering how they achieved that. Also the drums and percussions with the shit ton of reverb makes it grandious. When I try to recreate something similar the reverb sounds too controlled and smooth, not as big as the song. Somehow when the reverb is in stereo is makes it smaller, too polished?

I currently play guitar and bass and have a way to record that. I've always held off on recording anything fully created by me since I can't record (or write or play lol) any real drums and I've been into alt rock, shoegaze, and thrash metal for most of my life. I've written songs on my own with just guitar and bass and recorded covers of songs before however. Recently I have been listening to a lot more modern music with drum machines and synths and such. Trench, Minecraft Volume Alpha, KIDS SEE GHOSTS, Plastic Beach, and To Pimp a Butterfly are the main 4 albums I've been listening too. Anyway my question is about what gear I would need to get started making music (on my own) that sounds something like these albums, mainly Trench and Plastic Beach since I can't really rap (and can sing). I currently have 2 guitars, a bass, a guitar amp, a pedalboard (with reverb, delay, fuzz, phaser, and distortions), a Volt 1 audio interface, E906 mic, M40x Headphones, and a Desktop PC with Reaper (the infitinite free trial) installed. I think I need a drum machine, sampler, possibly mixer, and keyboard or synth (I plan to learn gow to play one very soon, within a week or two). However what else could I need, and what of models of what stuff should I get. I would prefer to spend less than 400-500 dollars on all of this. I would also like to know what plugins and such I could use for mixing the music after (if possible to fit into the budget). Thanks for reading all of this lol

I've looking pretty hard at the MXL 2003A. It sounds a big step up from the other sub 200 dollar mics. I'm looking for a ""darker"" sounding mic. As dark as it can go, possibly. I have a really present voice in the mid-to-upper sort of area.

Most budget condensers sound pretty messy to me, often too harsh to even use. To much of the highs as well usually. The Rhode NT-1 and the Audio-Technica AT2020 both seem a little off for me. And the Behringer is... Well. You know.

Anyway, about that MXL. [Here's an... oddly good demo of the mic. I still want to know if that's an original song](https://youtu.be/cHFJ045jlQU)

zrd29r,Do music producers really gatekeep?,"(TLDR: I feel like music producers do gatekeep because I notice a huge difference in the quality of professional music relative to the available tools and resources we get for them)

This topic has been going over my head for a while now, and because of the number of crystalline mixes I've listened to in the past few months, I really have to ask myself this question: **Do music producers gatekeep?**

Before I go into depth what I mean when I say this, I mean, music producers ***perhaps*** having a secret group of connections amongst themselves where they continually develop their sound in order to improve the quality of their mixes. Or it could be that one is good friends with someone else who has insane samples (which either are or could be previously borrowed from another person itself) or presets or effect rack presets or anything and decides to share them for support. 

It could even be music production techniques which are in fact extremely effective, but isn't shared on e.g. YouTube. But is this really a big deal? What's so hard about approaching this improvement with the lone-wolf method? Well obviously it is mainly that I have a sound library that already sucks, because I have quite a narrow view of where to look for stuff, and to make a good sound from sounds that suck can be extremely time-costing and especially strays me away from actually making songs.

So obviously I am not certain whether the above theory is really true or not, but it can definitely be certain that there is a really significant disparity in quality between the sample packs which are provided for our music production and that of the music from the professional producers we know of, which is indeed why this question had been boggling in my head. Why is this disparity so huge? Why is it that (for example) drums from sample packs, even from paid ones, are either extremely distorted, badly EQed, or badly compressed/limited, when such of those from professionals sound perfect in context of the mixes they make?

Obviously the reason is because of post-processing right? Maybe there are samples that seem either terrible or non-directional when you play it by itself until you actually apply effects to them, which may have been used by professional producers. Post-processing definitely helps in most of the circumstances rather than not using them at all. 

However, I see those FLPs and Ableton tracks and the samples list and then I see all those samples starting with 4 capital letter initials and those production tutorials (how to make \[something\]) and I just see producers drag in already refined/polished samples in and it sounds effortlessly amazing. Minimal effects applied, as they boast ""less is more"" on samples that already have ""more"". I even see those professionals themselves livestream their project breakdowns, and when they explain their sounds, they say something around the sort of ""oh I got this from \[XXXX\], credits to / shoutout to him"". Like, where do I find them? Where can I find them? I search for these 4 capital letter initials + ""sample pack"" and random junk which has those initials in the title of those websites come up, as if it doesn't publicly exist, yet I see millions of project playthroughs somehow have them.

One could argue, samples are 90%+ sound design, and sound design is free for everyone, especially with awesome synthesizers like Vital and Surge, and with enough fundamental knowledge, can have maximum control over the morph of their sound. This argument would then become ""it's not that complicated, you just aren't good enough"", even when they probably didn't need to do things the hard way because they have connections that could supply them exactly what they want. 

So now I ask this question again, **do music producers gatekeep,** or is it me that's the problem? Do I just have to be a bit more outgoing to producers and kindly ask for better samples? I personally like to work alone, as I am quite an introvert and social interactions are sometimes a difficulty for me. Moreover, I only produce music because I enjoy it, not because I want to be apart of a ""producers community"" to the point that I have my identity basically defined as being part of something than just being myself.",1671605955.0,Producers,6,841,35,4258

zqiejl,My gf made a somewhat hurtful comment about my interest in music production and I'd like other opinions,"hi there,

yesterday I was rambling to my gf once again of how I love music production and teaching myself the stuff even though I ain't that good at composing, etc.

She lost patience and replied: ""you're 30, why do you keep entertaining this fixation, be realistic, you can't *sacrifice your life* for something as low-reward as your music aspirations, your never seem happy about yourself, let it go, focus on things you are more talented to,"" etc. What hurts is her saying I'd rather *sacrifice and not live my life*, assumedly to cling to a pipe dream.

To an extent, she's kinda right. I'm often found slacking at my job because I rather watch music production videos, and I am lonesome, meaning that I don't engage in the usual social stuff like birthday parties, new year's eve parties, holidays, etc... Well I do it to keep my relationship going, but I wouldn't do it on my own because I see that as distractions from the main goal. This attitude might bring me some trouble in life, but I also consider it's my own choice.

She also says that if I was serious about that, then I'd take a 4-year tuition in a conservatory with clear goals, and make a career. Which I simply can't because the money and energy investment is high, and I don't even want an academical career, I ain't no cello player, choir leader nor music teacher, my pleasure is simply programming midi bars on a DAW. She says I should have in-person classes rather than online classes (skillshare) because those online lessons would be ineffective. But as I'm living expatriated, finding the right lessons in my language or at least in english is a pain.

At this point, I don't know how to balance my desire for teaching myself music and living a somewhat normie life. I hate the idea of coming back from my job and having nothing to create. I prefer to create my shit musics, even if they're never going to be recognized as such, at least I'm trying...

I also believe I really fucked up the part in life where I'm supposed to surround myself with like-minded friends, obviously.

I don't see myself earning money from any musical skill of mine right now, but I think with some consistency I might just be able to sell bits and bobs on fiverr in the next 5 to 10 years, after all I'm interested in sound design presets, and I have a good baritone voice. Of course it's no superstar career, but if I can add 100 or 200 dollar monthly to my job salary one day, that's satisfying too.

If anyone can recommed online teachers or quizzes that could assess my potential and test the knowledge I've already erratically built, I'd be grateful. I don't want to let go of this part of me, even if it is a mistake.

zpq17z,Can you apply pitch correction to a Stereo Recording of a 5 Man Choir?,"Guy wants a song that is entirely acapella.

I guess his first idea was to just do multiple takes of himself singing, harmonising with himself.

Although we're probably gonna try this idea too, my advice was for him to do a proper recording of an actual acapella crew. 5 people singing simultaneously, each with a close mic and also a stereo pair in the room to make it more a natural and interesting version of the song.

If he's up for hiring some professional singers it's no big deal since we're bound to get a decent take sooner or later.
However, we're trying to budget the whole thing and the best thing would be to have a few friends sing, musicians that do have the ability to sing but are not professional, so pitch could be an issue. He himself is not the best singer, kind of off pitch and not the cleanest voice, especially on higher registers.

I've been doing this for almost 7 years. I've been using regular PC's which currently perform below what is needed. I never did mixing and mastering until recently and it was at that moment when I realized I needed something more oriented to music production as my regular PC started to give me problems: It freezes, the program doesn't start, strange and annoying sounds are attached when play directly from FL Studio. In summary, my PC is not made for those kinds of tasks. I've noticed those problems appear when I use pads on my tracks and when I used plug-ins such Sausage Fattener and Soundgoodizer, again, when it comes to upgrade and give more power to the sounds from the stems I already built.

After what I exposed my question is simply: which PC do you recommend? I don't care if it is desktop or laptop. Please, take in account I'm not a professional, make this for fun as a hobby, I don't need the ultimate PC, just something that doesn't crash and let me reproduce the steams and final track with all plug ins.

Taking into consideration the way the music industry shifts constantly and the next set of producers are much more different to the last with the whole “bedroom production” and doing research about studying I see very opposing opinions.

The one thing I mainly lack is a “platform” to push my music - either connections or a following ETC so Idk about the whole “buy the equipment instead of wasting the money on the degree” response because my music could be out of this world but we both know I’ll probably be consumed by the other 100k songs being released daily on Spotify.

Currently I’m taking a year out after my A-Levels (making an album and going travelling, working ETC) 

Ultimately my end goal is to be a highly successful Artist/Producer. I’m aware of how much of a long shot that is but it’s what I enjoy most and it’s not like the music scene is going to be the same as it is now in 10 years.


The unis I’ve mainly been looking at for music tech/production/sound engineering courses are LIPA, Surrey, Birmingham City, UWE Bristol and I can’t find any high ranked uk unis with music tech courses as most don’t have it and there’s no rankings for music production unis or anything like that so these are what I found overall to be the most competitive and rewarding. 

Lipa seems pretty washed up for creative musical talent in recent years but still seems like the most likely I’ll get picked up if what I’m doing is actually great quality and Surrey has pretty good graduate wage perception stats but doesn’t seem like the type of path to be going down when I want to be a Pop/hip-hop/R&B/jazz artist? And do I really want to be in Guildford 🥴🤢

zorewe,"Honestly, I think academia, experts and books misrepresent how wild mixer engineers/producers are when it comes to EQ, compression, etc","I mean, it seems like they try to be all professional and cautious with the advice of not going overboard with effects and of course it must be said that professionals often receive quality recordings but there seems to be a disproportionate difference between advice found in academic books, courses, and how professionals actually use the tools. By working and seeing videos of mixers in the job, I have seen how they decimate tracks with disproportionate amounts of compression, EQ (specially lots of high end!) and/or distortion-- the amount of reverb does seem to be conservative though-- i have seen compression meters go all the way through and EQs maxed out

I think the problem seems to arise because such courses strive to be general and universal, incluiding all kinds of styles like classical, jazz or world music.

But for anyone going for mainstream, modern type of sounds a.k.a the entire popular music industry, i definitively would not recommend the conservative approach (of course if you have bad recordings you will probably just exacerbate problems).",1671342812.0,Producers,24,194,135,1071

And yet, it's actually supposed to be something very simple, scientific and mathematical, right? I get the mathematics behind it, I get how it relates to the time signature, etc. But I still can't confidently write down the melody in my head in stave notation with correct note lengths. 

And then, I actually want to get it right not just for the main melody, but for the drum parts as well. Basically, if I get the note lengths correct, it's a lot easier to fill in the piano roll in the DAW - everything aligns with the grid and it's easier to copy paste.

&#x200B;

So I am not quite sure if this a question to be asked here but this has been bothering me for quite some time. I have KRK RP 5 Rokit monitors and been using them for about 5 years. Now I believe I have the wrong type of cables for the monitors, even though the do work. I think I read somewhere that if you use the wrong type of cables that, yes, they will work, but they will add nasty hissing sounds (or whatever you call it). But now to the problem itself. My left monitor sometimes doesn't play any sound or it plays it really quiet compared to the right monitor which is working just fine. Sometimes I just manage to solve it by wiggling around with the cable connected to the left monitor indicating it might be caused by the cable. Whether it's faulty or just the wrong type of cable, I am not sure of. Also sometimes I manage to solve the problem by cranking up the volume from my audio interface. It's like you have a stuffy nose and then you just blow all that nasty stuff out and then your nose clears up and is normal again. Like I just crank up the volume during a playback to about 70-80% quite fast and then the left monitor starts working again.

zmsfex,logic pro latency hassle with multiple external midi instruments,"Hey all

I am coming from years and years of stubborn Reason usage. Since I got an M1 macbook though not everything is going fluently and I also had a hard time getting it to talk to my midi controllers. 


I´ve been exploring Logic for a while and overall it´d been a pretty exciting experience. I am still running into several issues however. Mostly regarding latency.

I´m running a couple of hardware synths as external instruments and as my project grows latency starts becoming an issue. Even when I disable most effects. It doesn´t seem to matter much. I think I will need to approach projects a little differently, but there is one thing that annoys me hard. 

When I enable low latency monitoring, some of my hardware synths play ahead(!) of time! So kind of reverse latency. I guess logic looks ahead to the midi notes. There is an option to ´auto-compensate´ and sometimes it works to enable it, or disable it... it´s all depending on whether I use low latency monitoring etc. 
But then when I set e.g. an 8 bar loop, things really go on the fritz when it goes to the starting point. Things will run great for 8 bars and then stuff goes out of sync again. 

I gues I could circumvent this issue by adapting my workflow but it just seems so weird to me that this is such a hassle. 

I booted up LIVE today as I got frustrated and might give this another go. But maybe someone out there has a fix for me or would want to help me along if I can provide some screenshots or video.

zmqhfp,Setting Up Simple Beat making and synth rig with old laptop,"So, I have an old Dell laptop that still runs ok, and I have an Arturia Minikey and a DrumBrute. I'm wondering if, with these three things, I could make a recording setup for making drum beats with a little synth in the mix. 

It would be really cool if I could use this as a live rig, although that's optional if doing that would be a lot of extra work/money.

I'll be playing fuzz bass/guitar over the beats, so I'm thinking I wouldn't need too much in the way of programs. I'm thinking I could run Reaper, use that to load my soft synth and maybe a drum VST if I'm not satisfied with the Drumbrute's sounds (assuming I know what I'm talking about. From what I understand, the USB connection on the DrumBrute just covers MIDI data, which I'm thinking means I could use the DrumBrute as a sequencer).

Is what I'm describing feasible and practical? I'm looking for some middle ground between a full-blown live EDM setup and plugging an MP3 player into the sound board. Is there a better way than using my old laptop?

I'm also wondering if I'll need any other gear. I'm thinking I might need an interface in order to run the sound out of the laptop. Maybe a small USB mixer would work.

Speaking of, should I anticipate any technical problems trying to use more than one USB sound device at a time? I've never actually tried that.

I hear other people always saying that the way  led zeppelin recorded sounds fantastic (i agree) but i can't find videos or such abt it

What mics did they use and what techniques?


All i know is that Eddie Kramer said they all played it live/at the same time w the exception of when one of them plays multiple instruments on one song
And that they kept the mistakes etc in for character


I've also read that john bonhams drums used the Glyn John's micing technique


Jimmy page used his supro amp and telecaster for alot of solos (especially early zeppelin era) but also other amps but favoured small amps in the studio to easily make them distort


John Paul Jones
His bass somehow always sounds so huge (this part is the one I'm personally most interested in)

He used his 1962 fender jazzbass with rotosound 45 flatwoundson most early recordings
His main amp Live was the acoustic 360 but I'm not fully sure if thats what he used in the studio

I believe his amp was miced atleast most of the time since you hear some vibrating in example dazed and confused and other songs
Some songs also sound like he has a leslie on like heartbreaker but dont quote me on that
(Not sure if he DI'd? But i feel like he partially did since the bass sounds so huge)

I dont know alot abt his keyboard stuff tho other than the diferent keyboars he used and that he sometimes used a maestro Phase shifter at times


As i said earlier i dont know what mics they used so i cant say alot about Robert Plant



Im not really sure what studio equipment they used

I'm back on a 60's rock binge, and just love the power of these mono recordings so much! How can I emulate this in modern daws? 

My main concern is : should I mono everything? Like put Ableton utility (or J37 mono) on every track and every group or was there actually some stereo going on? When I read about how they recorded I understand that there was like 3 mics on drums, one or two on amps, and ambience most of the time. This will give a stereo recording... Are all these mics then summed in mono? 

Listening to Cream Disraeli Gear or Sgt Pepper or first incarnation of Pink Floyd the mono versions always sounds way heavier and more powerful, but I also understand that trying to make mono with stereo was obviously going to sound bad (those damn drums in the left ear only).

Basically I’m just trying to use FL studio, or even a stand-alone app, as a guitar amp simulator. It is just easier for my current situation, to make practice more accessible.

I am currently using a real tone (rocksmith) cable and experiencing a little latency. I believe my pc specs are fine to run a plugin or 2 and not experience latency, as they’re just free plugins and not that intense, and I use my pc for much more intense things on the regular. I have it set to the best settings I can (6 ms) through FL.

I’m using FL ASIO for the driver, as asio4all doesn’t seem to allow me to use the real tone cable as an input. 

From what I’ve gathered it’s an issue with the sound card, so I thought making the output my DAC may help, but there’s still a little latency. Is there any way to get this perfect or close to? My understanding is even if I get a cheap interface and use it for the input and output, that should get me to where I want to be (as close to no latency as possible.) does that sound right?

after making most of my beats from scratch without any prerecorded loops from the internet, I recently stumbled upon some loops in a sample pack that I want to use for future projects. After trying to start a beat based on a loop I encountered the problem that I have no ducking clue which chords and single notes are played in any given loop. The individual notes might not be so relevant as only their key matters but for chords I think it's somehow important to know which are played as my bass line and further chord layers as pads/pianos sound kinda off if the chords are way off even in the same scale.

I mean I could try out every of the 7 chords of a scale for every single chord played in a 4bar loop but I thought there me more methodological and better solutions to my problem.

I'm using Logic Pro 10.7.5. and I have a basic understanding of music theory. I'm able to find out the scale of any loop with just my hearing and a electric piano in a matter of 5 minutes (I know nothing impressive, just wanted to let you know where I'm currently at).

Then I remind myself that I think this way because I suck even more than those very producers. Like literally, I may as well be the scum of the Earth. I completely suck at everything, intro, buildup, drop and everything. I don’t even know what does and doesn’t go well together, or how I can even get the sounds I want in the first place. And then I see these shining and positive and all people do it seamlessly as if it’s just not a big deal and it’s extremely simple. Great, now obvious I shouldn’t compare myself with experienced people right? Not until literally every person I’m friends with who sucked more than me or even just STARTED quickly rose to the top and leaving me behind.

I can’t take it! So what did I do? I crammed in billions of music production tutorials, copying them step by step, hoping to get some good sounds and knowledge and experience. And so I learnt how to make sounds, yet I still don’t even find purpose in them nor have the ability to relate them to a real track. I tried suffering myself to only produce for entire days. Cried, got over it, tried again. And I still suck. Asked friends for tips. They tell me the exact same shit I heard so many times it’s as if I can just develop an ego by saying I understand when I clearly don’t. I’ve stagnated as a producer for 2 years and I’m feeling worse about myself each minute yet I don’t want to.

When I hit play, the midi track on the piano roll is also taking 1-5 seconds to play. The live marker is well ahead of whatever notes are actually playing.

That's all using on-board Realtek with ""generic asio lowatency driver"". I can restart cubase to fix it... for 10 seconds.

But, when my audio output is set to my yamaha mixer using steinberg asio drivers everything works fine. I mean, besides the fact that I have to hook up to my mixer instead of just outputting sound to my laptop speakers. Things trigger instantly, without crackle even with a 32 byte buffer.

I am currently looking into upgrading my home studio. I am using a Komplete audio 6 mk2 as my main interface and (before it broke for the second time and I've decided to never use it again) an ART Tube MP Studio as my pre-amp. Now the built in pre-amps in the Komplete audio 6 are not bad but they are a bit dull for me, however I really grew to like this interface, but the pre-amps in it won't cut it for me so I'm struggling to make a decision. 

I don't have a lot to spend on these items so what I'm about to mention IS the target price range. 

So I've been looking at the the SSL2+ for a while now however I need 4 ins and 4 outs minimum so it wasn't an option up until now with the **SSL12**. I really like it however for some reason I feel If I'm ever going to upgrade my interface I want an interface that I can grow into sort of, you know something that will future proof my studio such as the: Audiofuse Studio, UAD apollo 4x, Antelope stuff. However those are way out of my budget right now, and would be pointless at this stage of my career. So I feel like I might regret the SSL12 because it wouldn't bring that much to the table my komplete isn't already bringing. 

So I thought about buying a pre-amp and I'm really drawn to the **Golden Age Premier PRE-73**  Based on my research it sounds great, I like the air switch on it, and I like how DI guitars sound through it. Problem is the future is kind of unpredictable, might have to move around, a lot of on the go production, so an external pre-amp wouldn't work in that scenario. I know this isn't a life changing decision, however I'm in a spiral and can't think straight so I need outside opinions.

So which one would you prefer SSL12 vs Golden Age Premier PRE-73 ? 

I know this whole thing is subjective but I'm really interested to see what you would pick, or if you have a little time, your thought process.

zl77a3,Reference track analysis (metal),"Hi music production friends!

I've been trying to up my reference track game, and have done some analysis on a set of songs in the metal/rock genre which I thought may interest some of you.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

I'm primarily interested in the loudness, ""loudness range""\*, and tonal balance of the tracks. The process I followed was:

* Rip the songs from Spotify (with loudness normalisation disabled);
* Crop a typical ""Chorus"" and ""Verse"" for each track;
* Run the full track, chorus, and verse through YouLean Loudness Meter;
* Crunch some numbers to work out things like values used for normalisation on Spotify, ""loudness range"" etc;
* Run all the tracks (full, and choruses only) through iZotope Tonal Balance to generate target curves for the set.

&#x200B;

**Observations**

* The songs are mastered louder than I thought they would be, with most choruses clocking in are -5iLUFS.
* There's a lot of variety in loudness ranges between the tracks, some managing 25 LU difference between the quietest section of the song and the chorus; and one < 6 LU.
* Tool - Pneuma manages to achieve the loudest chorus post-Spotify normalisation, despite being the quietest mastered chorus, thanks to the track's many soft sections.
* The spread of tonal balances is MUCH tighter than I was expecting when considering only the choruses. The ""rock"" target curve preset in Tonal Balance Control suggests a much wider spread than I observed here. I'll definitely be mixing/mastering my tracks to fall within this tighter limit from now on.

&#x200B;

**Figures**

Hope this is useful for some of you guys! I'd strongly recommend getting together a custom set in your genre to help with mixing/mastering. I'm now one step closer to my tracks not sounding like garbage!

I'd love to know if anyone has done anything similar. I'd also be interested in knowing how I could do something similar for stereo width, (or any other metrics I should be looking at).

&#x200B;

\*A note on ""loudness range"": I find the metrics available in the YouLean plugin don't quite give me what I'm after in terms of measuring a song's ""dynamic"" or ""loudness"" range. For each track I ended up calculating two values:

1. How much greater the Integrated LUFS (iLUFS) for the Chorus is than the iLUFS for the Verse
2. How much greater the iLUFS for the Chorus is than the Short Term Loudness of the quietest section of the song. (The quietest section being identified by hand, ignoring silences and fade ins/outs)

Bonus tip for those who got this far: I also calculated how much to adjust each track for mixing, such that the Chorus of each track clocks in at -22iLUFS, making it easy to compare like-for-like during mixing. I also created a group in Ableton with each of the Chorus sections aligned, and the same for verses, with the appropriate gain reduction applied so I can drop the whole thing into any project and solo them easily.",1670966167.0,Producers,6,690,32,3293

I really enjoyed it and would like to share it one day, but then I hit a little bump where I just don't know what to do without it all sounding the same. I haven't made anything since the beginning of last month, but I've worked on mixing for the previous tracks I planned to release, and that's about it. I'll go into the studio with a blank mind after feeling creative for so long, and I can't do anything. How do you guys go back to the drawing board with ideas? I'm also trying to find a way to incorporate guitars into my music, so it's not all strictly keyboard music, but always draw a blank on where they should go. I can put bass in there, that's one of the easiest parts, but guitar I just go blank on writing. It's probably a case of the musical style and I need to try something different, but I'm really working towards being a soundtrack producer than a DJ or whatever else most people want to be.",1670955922.0,Producers,10,258,45,1158

Ive thought of the following:

1) upgrade monitor size (but not sure that is great for my size of room).

2) use eq software.

3) get more expensive monitors. Monitors that come to mind are Adam a7x or focal shape 65. I can’t afford much higher than that….well I can but wife would get mad….

I got a focusrite and with it came a free autotune access license, which is great since there is no real way to get the autotune effect via stock plugins in my DAW (ableton). However the installation process of autotune is really concering. They require you to install codemeter first, reading up online I found lots of reports about codemeters security lacking and it being a potential backdoor to your PC. Not only that but I have tons of issues with it when it comes to the functionality: after activating my license for my current computer I accidentally deactivated it, problem now is that I can't reactivate it either (always get an internal error message), and it also says that I only have 1 activation remaining which is massively confusing (it should be 2). I didn't find much discussion about it online so I wanted to talk about a few things:

Did anyone else have issues with Codemeter or noticed security weaknesses? 

Are there any autotune plugins that can be easily installed with just an installer where you log in to? (similar to native instruments plugins for instance)

From my very limited knowledge it looks like the CPU and RAM are sufficient for music production that I do (which generally doesn't include things like 10+ VST instruments running side-by-side, or massive multi-track recording projects). But I am wary that I might be missing something.

I recently purchased a new audio interface for my home studio (Audient Evo 4) because my Scarlett Solo (2nd Gen) did not have balanced 1/4” outputs, so I had to use an RCA to 1/4” cable in order to connect my studio monitors, and it introduced a lot of noise.

108xlhz,How do I send stems from my DAW to a live sound engineer during a performance?,"Asking here because I've been having a tough time finding the right answers on my own, and really need help.

I make electronic music and plan to do more performances this year. Already have one lined up in a few weeks so I need to figure things out on the technical side ASAP. I'm running an Ableton session on my laptop on stage, which will play: backing tracks, click, and instruments played in real time on a MIDI controller. Separately from that, I will also be singing, which will be processed by a vocal effect processor (TC Helicon Perform VE), which can go directly to front of house.

What I've done in previous performances is have my interface connected to the laptop, and send a stereo mix to front of house, but have the click just going to my headphones which are also plugged into my interface. I'm not happy with this solution and want to improve things.

I heard that sending separate stems for different instruments (like separating drums, bass, etc) is preferable for live sound engineers because they can have more control over the live mix. This makes sense, especially since my vocals are being processed separately from other sounds, and also due to every venue having different acoustics.

I already know how to send different tracks virtually in Ableton's Session View to different outputs, but haven't managed to figure out the gear side of things...I have a second-hand 1st gen Scarlet Focusrite 6i6, which is supposed to have 6 outputs but it actually only has 4 TRS outputs and 2 SPDIF ones. I don't know anything about SPDIF but I think all TRS would probably be preferable for consistency. I might be wrong though, but either way I'm having issues with Scarlet Mix Control (the software that comes with my interface). I just cannot get it to send different stems out of different outputs. No matter what I try, it always sends the same thing through both outputs 1/2 and 3/4. My suspicion is that the software just sucks, but maybe I'm missing something. So even though I have a TRS output 3/4, I haven't used them live yet, which is why my previous performance attempts were just a stereo send.

I will probably need at least 5/6 usable outputs: stereo percussion, bass (stereo or mono), and stereo everything else. Probably also need one for mono click track if I invest in a proper in-ear monitor setup, where I'm getting a full mix of everything from front of house. 

How do I do this? What gear do I require? Can it be done with a normal audio interface or do I need a special mixer of some kind? Is there anything different about interfaces for studio Vs live use? Should I upgrade my interface? (I'm already considering that) Any recommendations?",1673418063.0,Producers,17,547,78,2686

If I want to view all frequency collisions in Insight 2 for example, I have to insert a case of Neutron on each track \[forfeiting the ability to see frequency collisions between two oscillators on one synth patch (Will phase correlation meters be able to detect phase cancellation occurring within one synth patch?) 

But I don't need to the same to measure any phase correlation? How would a phase correlation meter know whether a signal that has reduced amplitude is due to phase correlation or just by sound design? (For example, some kick waveforms might look like 2 signals with phase cancellation)

107kaae,Learning Music Production in 2023 - A Roadmap,"Want to learn how to produce music in 2023, but have no idea where to start? Here's a roadmap I put together for anyone starting music production. In my opinion, this is how I would approach learning and improving your music - hopefully it is useful to some of you. If you have any questions, comment below or send me a DM.   
    
**Step 1: Choose a DAW:**  
Logic and Ableton are my favourite but they all mostly do the same thing, just in different ways. Each with strengths and weaknesses. Most DAWs will offer a free trial so try a couple out and see what clicks.    


**Step 2: Buy a basic set up:**  
Assuming you have a laptop / desktop that has decent CPU, RAM (16GB recommended) and Storage (500GB recommended) then a good pair of headphones is probably the first place to start. Audio Technica M50s or Beyerdynamic 770s are my favourite pairs on a budget. I’d also look to get an audio interface if you want to record external audio like guitars or vocals. I’d suggest getting at least 2 inputs. SSL and MOTU make extremely good quality interfaces at a low price. Even if you don’t record an instrument or vocals, it will also be better for listening than the built-in soundcard of a laptop or desktop. I suggest good headphones over speakers because the acoustics of your room could skew your monitoring decisions. I'd also add a midi keyboard to your set up pretty early on even if you aren't a keys player. It will help a lot with the process. You can pick up many types of 25 key keyboards for under $100.   
     
**Step 3: Learn Your DAW:**    
The basics can be picked up from youtube videos, forums or from tuition and courses. (I also teach production between composing or mixing production/library music.) This is the order of things I would learn things in. Obviously, an EDM artist will want to learn slightly different concepts to a singer-songwriter and the process will be slightly different, however this is the way I would approach it generally:

1. How to record midi.
2. How to record audio.
3. How to edit midi.
4. How to edit audio.
5. How to use samples and loops.
6. How to use synthesizers and software instruments.
7. How to use effects to improve the sound. (EQ, Reverb, Compression, etc.)
8. How to arrange a track. 
9. How to mix a track.
10. How to master a track.

There is quite a bit to learn within each of these steps, but that is the order I would go in and structure my learning.    
**Step 4: Get feedback:**   
In order to improve, it is important to get feedback on your completed music from friends, family, forums and ideally professionals where possible. Anyone’s advice can be helpful though, particularly in the beginning. Obviously, stay true to yourself, but listen to what others have to say and try applying their advice.  


**Step 5:** **Improving your weaker areas:**   
Common problems I help my intermediate students with are:

* Not being able to finish tracks - therefore I would look into arrangement.
* Not being able to get a professional sound - this mainly comes down to sound selection, mixing and arrangement. Mixing is a huge topic in of itself and can be extremely frustrating to learn.
* Running out of ideas - learning some music theory can help with this, taking a break, and listening to some different music can all help here.

**Step 6:** **Seek more feedback:**   
Repeat Step 4 basically until you achieve your musical goals. You can’t get better without constructive criticism so you do need to put yourself out there. It can be scary at times but it will make you a better producer.    


Hope this helps some of you! Cheers, Adam.",1673285410.0,Producers,8,785,45,3617

I'm a vocalist in learning whos finally getting to a point i'm feeling more confident in my ability and i'm looking to invest in my first recording mic.

For effects, I have Baby Audio's Comeback Kid, CableGuys HalfTime, RC-20, smartReverb by sonible and iZotope Vinyl (free but amazing for automating record stop).

For mixing/metering, I have SmartEQ3, smartComp2, trueLevel, trueBalance, KNOCK (and KNOCK clipper).

For mastering, I have Ozone 10 Standard, smartLimit, soothe2 and Purple Audio's  MC 77.

For vocals I have RePitch Pro and VocAlign Ultra.

Any gaps I fill with Ableton's stock plugins.

I do have a whole bunch of brainworx plugins too but I prefer visual displays so they mostly sit unused.

Recently got into music production. I use to produce my own vocals in Logic Pro X but I wanted to get started in production.  

I recently bought a couple of studio monitors, Edifier MR4’s. They are all connected through my audio interface. My left speaker has pretty annoying feedback buzz that I can’t seem to fix. I updated the drivers on my interface as well but that did not help. I also noticed that there is a lag when I play music in FL studio. For instance, if I press a note on my keyboard, it’ll make the sound in FL .5 seconds later. This is the same when I just play a track. I noticed FL is pretty glitchy as well ever since I connected these monitors. What should I do? When I plug in my headphones everything else is fine

But even with that I just can't get anything to mastering stage, it might be a conflict of self doubt or self esteem but it's really frustrating when my mind is blank. And yet, I've invested quite a bit into physical hardware, it's the greatest, it's always fun to make sounds out of individual pieces of music gear, but in the end, I just cannot make those pieces of hardware come together and make something I am genuinely proud of. 

So I ask myself, ""Do I like producing? Or Do I just like the gear?"" This might just be me being frustrated by a creator's block, but I honestly wonder if I should leave the hobby and just focus on collecting these pieces of hardware, and play with them individually.

My old cheap closed back for vocal recording has died so I've been trying Sony 7506 and BD DT770 Pro (80 ohms) for use with my RME Fireface 400.

The Sony seem louder, as you'd expect with lower resistance than the DT770 but I can't really tell them apart at this stage (only tried them tonight).

I have Sonarworks on the way which should correct the speaker profiles a little for a flatter response for mixing, whatever I decide to keep.

What's *really* confusing me is that I've looked at frequency response curves and my OPEN-backed AKG 702s, which I got for mixing (hence open backed) have a *terrible* frequency response compared to the DT 770 (albeit I only see the 250ohm version on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com), perhasp the 80 is very different?).  Which got me thinking...

I'm only in practice  mixing on closed back headphones because I've found when I'm laying down vocals at night time I couldn't be bother to swithc back and forth to the AKGs. But now looking at the frequency response I'm thinkin these closed backs are better than the open back AKGs (!), which I don't understand - maybe cheap openbacked are no good?

I'm wondering if I should just do away with the AKGs if they're not as good for mixing as the Sony or Beyer.  And of the 7506 v 770 (80), what do people reckon?  Can I get away with mixing on them?   Is there a better closed back ""jack-of-all-trades"" headphone, if I'm only gooing to be using one and recouping some money sellign off the AKGs?

Any advice appreciated!

Or if any of you know people who work for them, could you please relay this message on to them and see what they say?

It seems like such an oversight but it makes it so difficult to take hands-on control of parametric eq's because you need potentially 50-100 rotary dials. The parameters for each band are usually identical so why not just map them once and have the ability to cycle through which band is in focus using another rotary dial or buttons?

The only one I know of that can do this to some extent is the FabFilter Pro Q3, but it only applies when the plugin is on a MIDI channel which makes the feature unusable when working with audio.

I know that open back headphones sound a lot more spacial and have more clarity in the highs whereas closed back allows for a bit more punch to cut through in the low end. I produce kind of an alternative style of house music where the low end is super important to reference and also for the time being have an air conditioning/heater unit in my Studio that I sometimes need on and am worried about the 1990 pro picking some of that noise up as im mixing, so for those reasons im currently leaning towards the 1770 pro but if anyone thinks the 1990 pro is just clearly superior then I may be more interested in going with that. I also got to try out the 1990 pro from a friend who has it on my own interface and did notice they were pretty quiet due to being 250 ohms and may need something better to drive them so if anyone also could recommend a great headphone amp to go with either of these headphones I would appreciate any input on that as well.",1673726315.0,Producers,7,241,27,1207

[M-Audio Oxygen Pro Mini](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08MVB76SY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1)

AKAI Professional MPK Mini MK3 - 25 Key USB MIDI Keyboard Controller With 8 Backlit Drum Pads, 8 Knobs and Music Production Software Included (White)AKAI Professional MPK Mini MK3

(I also like the Akai mini play with the speaker feature, but its  $80 more expensive and from what I can tell it seems that and some drum beats is all that differs from the mk3, but still...worth it?)

So I am leaning towards the Akai pro mini because of all the good reviews and its long positive history in the industry and it having the basics.  But for the novation and oxygen, they come with ableton live and have some neat features as well such as the ability to do arpegios, comes with ableton live (which was the daw I wanted to start with), etc.  I guess what it comes down to is it worth the extra $50 or so dollars for the extra features of the others over the Akai?  And do I need them at a beginners level?

I was messing around synths and changing some of then to my own sound, but then I found ""Evolving Currents"" and I said ""This sounds familiar"" I Immediately remenber the theme from earthbound and started thinking what kind of usage I or anyone could give to the synth of earthbound.",1673644423.0,Producers,19,123,84,607

10b3y21,Recommendations for drum looping on mac,"Hi,

I've been using the virtual drummer on garageband and logic to create demos, but I'm getting frustrated with it. It's annoying when you find a great part, drop it in your track, and then if you paste it somewhere else or move it along, the sequence changes.
Can anyone recommend any programs with very similar functionality that allow you to adjust the style, tempo and complexity of a pattern, but use the part as a loop that won't change when you want to move it?
Or alternatively can anyone tell me if I'm missing something in garageband or logic that would stop that happening?
