107hyjj,Pads vs Keyboard dynamic accuracy.," Hi,

I have some weird and a bit annoying experience with my Maschine controller. I've tried different sensitivity settings, and I feel that pads sensitivity set to 90 and dynamic curve to Linear, or Hard 1 give me best results, but... it still sucks compared to keyboard midi controller.

Especially when I try to play percussion libraries, playing on keyboard feels just right, all the dynamic and feeling is there. When I start to lightly tap keyboard, and gradually increase the pressure, it will nicely and smoothly play it just like in real life (well, as for midi library ofc).

But when I play on pads on Maschine or Korg NanoPad it just feels wrong and all over the place. It lacks the smoothness of keyboard dynamic curve when keys are pressed. Very often when I push it slightly I get proper dynamic, but when gradually increase the pressure it just make weird spikes in dynamic, it just not smooth at all.

Playing keyboard and pads for comparison at the same time, the difference in accuracy is insane.

Maybe its ""pad thing"", or something else, but for my observations pads are far less accurate in dynamic curve than keyboard.

What do you think?",1673280018.0,medstonee

1076yan,"Having trouble picking a DAW, looking for advice/suggestions.","Hey all,

I’ve been using FL Studio for quite awhile now and I’m really looking to make a switch. I like FL however I’m moving towards a pop-rock / alt-rock direction (Weezer, Pixies, CSH, etc) and I’m looking for a better suited DAW for me to use for primarily tracking guitar, vocals, occasionally live drums but also being able to program drums and bass when needed.

Currently I’ve tried Reaper, Ableton, and Pro Tools. I’m honestly just not a fan of Reaper and Ableton’s workflow has been a bit too difficult for me to get my head around. 

I’m also trying to keep price in mind. I don’t have a very big budget so I generally prefer subscriptions however I also am trying to find the best balance of initial/monthly price and included plugins + plugins I may need to get. (Primarily autotune and a guitar cab). I am enjoying Pro Tools Studio however the included plugins seem a bit lacking and again I’m really not trying to spend too much if I don’t need to. 

Cubase Elements and Studio One’s subscription currently have me very interested, as Elements appears to include a great guitar amp sim and autotune, and Studio One also appears to have quite the selection.

I think the question boils down to do I….

1. Stick with PT, shell out a bit of money for more plugins

2. Cubase Elements 12

3. Studio One Subscription 

Sorry for the wall of text, just feeling really lost with so many options and I really want to get situated in a “permanent” (using that word loosely) DAW.

1075kr6,Audio peaking over time and in midi editor within Reaper,"So I've been using reaper as a metal musician to write, well, metal music. Overall, my experience with Reaper has been well. It's easy to use, the price is fair, and it's just overall a good software. 

Over time, however, I've noticed a few things that kind of bug me, and I'm looking for a way to solve them:

1. I use the GGD invasion pack for my midi drums, and I love them. However, I've noticed that the audio starts clipping when I open the midi editor while the song is playing. When I am not in the midi editor while my track is playing, this does not happen. 

2. Over time, the audio progressively starts to clip worse and worse for everything. I fix this by opening a new project (not just closing Reaper, I have to open or start a new project) and then going back to the previous one I was just working on. This cycle continues indefinitely. 

3. Not a huge concern at the moment because I can work around it, but my audio input is just ""quiet."" What I mean by this is that my volume on my PC is almost all the way up and my guitar (if I raise the volume on my interface any more it starts clipping like mad) and drums just sound ""normal."" I tested this by inserting another song into another track and I nearly blew out my ear drums. 

Not sure if anyone else has these issues, but I would love to solve them asap as they are starting to really bother me.

106ro0t,First studio Mic - Neumann TLM102 vs Blue Baby Bottle SL?,"Hello everyone and Happy New Year!

I am about to open my first music studio and the only thing left for me to buy is the microphone; I was waiting until this point that I have tread acoustically the place and tried a couple of mics there (Warm Audio WA-47 and Shure SM7b).

I'd like to buy a condenser all-purpose (reggaeton, trap, hip-hop, ballads) -almost- microphone. (Recording acoustic guitar or miking up electric guitar amps would be great as well)

My 2 main options are the *Neumann TLM102* or the *Blue Baby Bottle SL*. I know, both microphones have a substantial difference in price, however that is not a problem.

I am leaning more towards the Neumann, since it is an industry standard and I know Neumann = quality; however, I have not tried it myself and some people say it lacks character and it's too flat or even too bright.

On the other hand, the Baby Bottle SL seems like an excellent option for the price, I have heard it previously on the studio and I was blown away by the quality, character and presence of the mic; kind of rumbly on the low end but nothing too serious, also the warmth the mic has is amazing.

As far as other options, I've eyed some other mics such as the Rode K2 and Warm Audio WA-47Jr, but I have yet to try them (don't think I can as of now, sadly).

Can I have some opinions on those mics to see what you guys think of them or even experiences with them? Also, extra suggestions would be much appreciated!

Recently I purchased DistroKid in an impulsive moment where I would have the same thoughtprocess but replace soundcloud with Spotify in this case. Yet some friends, who have been making music longer than me, say that Spotify is a different league and all and that I should first build a following on Soundcloud before uploading to Spotify. 

In a way I understand this, because Spotify IS a different league (and in my opinion a more commonly used way for listening to music) so with my songs, probably not that professionally mixed,  I understand they would not do that well on Spotifiy in terms of getting a following. But on the other hand I'd like to apply the same thoughtprocess of thinking that it's just for me and the little following of around 30 people I have haha. If I go further I also would say that it's great for creating content, because using distrokid, I could use my music in insta stories, as sounds for tiktok yada yada.

Anyways, I finally got a Scarlett 2i2 and recorded a song with it, and I wanna make sure I do things as best I can here. I have a couple of specific  questions.

One: what's a good way  to re-amp if I don't have a good room for sound recording? I could  probably figure something out, I'm just having trouble thinking on my  own what that might be. My initial plan was to forgo the re-amping  entirely and just go with amp and cabinet sims, but if anyone knows a  good way to mic up an actual amp in less-than-ideal conditions and still  get an acceptable sound, I'm all ears.

Secondly,  does anyone have any tips on layering? I figure even if I re-amp, I'd  still layer with sims. But I'm also wondering about any good methods of  layering tracks if I choose not to re-amp. Most of my music is  instrumental, so the guitar is generally right up front, and everything  else is support, so I'm looking for good, heavy guitar tones that  command alot of attention but still sound realistic.

Outside  of that, any bit of advice is appreciated! I'm pretty much out to learn  all I can, and after hours and hours of online research, I figure I'd  just see what people do out in the real world. Thanks in advance!",1673189179.0,eddie_of_ny

106jr4k,I think I FINALLY get why you use compression,"So for the longest time, I've known what a compressor does, but tbh I was pretty clueless about why you would actually use one, how it helps things sit in the mix, and how it can be used to maximize volume. 

For the longest time, I would put a compressor on something and while I could tell it was doing *something*, what exactly it was doing, I was kinda clueless about. 

Enter sound design and figuring out how to utilize volume envelopes to create transients. I started really being able to hear the transients in audio as I was designing them in certain sounds. 

Once I could actually make out what the transient of a sound sounded like, it was so much easier to hear compression working on something. I know transients aren't the only use for a compressor, but it's a big part of it, and being able to actually clearly hear when the compressor was in effect, really helped things to click for me.

I had always heard that compressors could be used to help things sit in the mix, but I honestly never knew why, tonight I finally had a breakthrough in that regard. I was mixing two horn sections together, one was in the higher frequencies playing a chord progression, and one was a lower burst of horns. When the burst of lower horns would come in, it would completely dominate the mix for the first second or so and the higher ones would briefly become very hard to hear, and it finally clicked for me: *the transient is that part that's making the other part hard to hear! If I use a compressor to smooth control that transient, I'll have the same effect with the sound and the same energy, but there will be enough headroom left over for the higher horns to shine through!*

It was a SERIOUS light bulb moment for me, it was like all of a sudden all of the use cases for compression came rushing in. Sounds that have alot of movement to them where they are fluctuating in volume, you can compress them so that you can clearly hear every part of it without having to jack the volume up possibly distorting or drowning out other sounds. 

It was like a cascade of ideas came to me, you can increase the overall loudness of a mix by applying a compressor to the whole, allowing things to reach their absolute max volume without having certain peaks distort or valleys become inaudible.

Is there any use cases I'm missing for compression? I feel like I'm feeling starting to get it, and it was one of those things I absolutely sucked at.",1673185946.0,danielnogo

106h08f,Multiple DAW and VST problems. RAM problems? Something else?,"I am running a Windows 10. 16GB RAM, i510600 and having multiple issues. With both Zenbeats (the Roland DAW) and Cakewalk by Bandlab. VST's I am using are Roland Cloud, the inbuilt Zenbeats sounds and Arturia Analogue V. 

The issues are many. Recording will just randomly stop after a few beats, or it will show it's recording but it isn't. The quantization will be way off. Cakewalk seems to be even worse, particularly with quantizing. They both just act super glitchy well beyong the point of being able to use them. If I just play (as opposed to record) any of the VST's through either DAW it works fine. 

RAM seems to be the obvious culprit, but the most RAM hungry part according to the spec recommendations is 8GB for Roland and I have double that.

A friend of mine mentioned compatibility when it comes to M1 chips; I've looked around this and as far as I can tell it's just a case of finding plugins that support it/using work arounds for those that don't. 

I currently get student discount on the apple store (no longer a student in 3ish months, so I'd like to take advantage of this now); which means I also get all apple software for £179 (Logic pro, mainstage, final cut pro, compressor, and motion) which is an absolute steal as I'd like to get into video editing also.

So, does software compatibility change with the M1/M2 chips? and if not, are there are reasons why I should take an M2 besides the very slight performance increase?

Basically I can take an M1 with upgraded ram (16gb instead of 8GB) for £250 cheaper compared to the M2 with upgraded ram; which would be ideal, but am I going to regret not going for the M2 in the future/for any reason?

1066b9g,Is this song plagiarized?,"First of all, I apologize if this is not the right sub for this question.

I heard the song ""Vieni nel mio cuore"" (released in 2022) by the Italian singer Ultimo, which immediately reminded me of The Wanted's ""Chasing the sun"" (released in 2012).

If you don't want to listen to both songs side by side, the most obvious parts are the choruses: [0:41](https://youtu.be/RFS5N_yAGTo?t=41), 1:48 & 2:39 in [Chasing The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFS5N_yAGTo) and [0:52](https://youtu.be/DoG5sIjFvHs?t=52), 1:47 & 2:23 in [Vieni nel mio cuore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoG5sIjFvHs).

And also the entire structure of Vieni nel mio cuore follows the structure of Chasing The Sun almost down to a T:

|The Wanted - Chasing The Sun|Ultimo - Vieni nel mio cuore||
|:-|:-|:-|
|0:00-0:26|0:05-0:32|Initial part|
|0:26-0:41|0:32-0:52|Buildup to the chorus|
|0:41-1:11|0:52-1:08|Chorus|
|1:11-1:26|1:08-1:27|Second part|
|1:26-1:41|1:27-1:47|Buildup to the chorus|
|1:48-2:03|1:47-2:02|Second chorus|
|2:03-2:19|2:02-2:23|Only part which could be considered a bit different, but still it is a buildup to the last chorus|
|2:19-2:39|2:02-2:23|In this part Ultimo's song is kind of a mix of this part and the 2:03-2:19 part of Chasing The Sun. It is a bit ""calmer"" like this part of Chasing The Sun, but it has lyrics.|
|2:39-3:11|2:23-2:56|Last chorus|

I'm not an expert in music, so I might be completely wrong, but to me, a layman, it seems way too obvious. The moment I heard the first few notes I remembered of The Wanted's song. Reading through the comments of the song, I wasn't the only one who noticed the resemblance.

Im an absolute beginner when it comes to arranging and producing music but i wanted to give it a try because music has been the most important thing in my life for as long as i can remember.

Im playing drums and ukulele, but i have no clue when it comes to music theory, this is what i focus on as next.

I bought FL Studio and a MIDI-keyboard for around 140 bucks and just started doing some stuff.

Ive a very little experience in some aspects, because i played around with Music Maker when i was a kid and i did a few remixes and mashups of popular songs using Audacity for the past few years.

But all those projects were just ""taking some songs and tracks that already exist and play around"" instead of creating something from scratch, recording (MIDI) all instruments by myself, arrange them, mix them, choose effects and produce it.

I wanted to start on some oldschool hip hop beats, i took Mockingbird and Stan by Eminem as inspiration.

I recorded some tracks, lead and sub-melody, drums, a few basslines and harmonies. More or less trial and error and what i could figure out by trying and hearing due to lack of knowledge in music theory.

Im actually satisfied by what its now, i kinda like it. But it sounds.. raw. 

And this is where my question starts:

How do i make my songs sound like a real production instead of a toy-song?

After i got the track as itself, the next step would be mastering and working with effects, right?

Are there any tips or tricks, any common used workflows, mechanics, effects that i could use? 

I tried to use some volume automations to make it more ""fluid"" and to create a flow, but it didnt really work well.

So the first sound is I guess you would call a synth beep or something. I hear it on the song ""e-er""   it's like the first melody you hear if anyone knows what that type of beat is called that would be great too. 

And then the other is just adding things like trumpets as the melody. Like j.cole middle child. Or lost and found by cordae. They sound so full of life and don't overtake the song. But when I try anything that isn't a piano my God I give myself a brain anureism. It's so loud and jarring. If I try to make it sound like notes, even if I follow the same chord progression it's.

I live with my family, and even though my bedroom is in the basement and is generally isolated from the other rooms, I still don't want to disrupt my folks if I need to stay up later to revise my vocals. What I tried previously was just wrapping a flannel around my head and the microphone, so literally anything is an improvement over that.

EDIT: After doing some research, I realized sound foam won't really prevent noise from traveling beyond my room, but would condense any unwanted echos or reverb, which I still think would be useful for a bedroom studio, so I'd still like to hear some suggestions! :)",1672943543.0,Frysken

1045o3y,I think I’ve lost some hearing from my eq and loud music,"So I’ve been making music for about a year or 2 now, and I wanted to better understand how to mix my songs properly. So as I watched tutorials I’ve learned that the eq is very important for mixing. I’ve kinda used eq before but I wanted to use it more seriously now. So when I used it to find unwanted frequencies in this loud edm type base, it seemed like it was going ok, but by the time I finished the song I’ve noticed that my left ear couldn’t hear as well as my right ear. Later on when I was working on more music, this time some 8 bit sounding song, I was only using my right ear Porsche to work on this song. However, I feel like I didn’t mix the instruments that well since now I’ve noticed that my right ear can hear a bit less than what it used to. Now I’m thinking this is because I’ve been listening to music on max volume for a while and because of the mixing stuff but idk. Any thoughts on what I should do to prevent this from getting worse?",1672942125.0,Triple_T1543

 I was pointed towards XO and Atlas 2 as alternatives , and I wanted to ask everyone how far has this tech gone recently? 
what plugins are at the cutting edge of being able to load up your own samples, and have a unique pattern generated?

Are there generators that can listen to a chord progression and generate a drum pattern to it using your own samples?  Are there plugins that can listen to a couple chords of a guitar and generate a bass line that actually works rhythmically and harmonically with the chord progression?  can I enter a chord progression like I-iv-V and have any instrument or drum pattern be auto generated?  will it read my mind? make fresh pots of coffee? Will it ruin the industry? what plug-in can I basically fart into and it will generate a more radio friendly fart and can adapt the fart to various popular and familiar but new rhythm and melody that I can then take large whiffs from inspirationally and take it from there?  When i produce large farts by myself, nobody seems to appreciate them like do. (some kind of “sounds like you need to buy a ‘butt plug-in’” joke would go well here)

And I am predicting some of reddit may say… “learn to make your own music, you cheating, lazy, fart smelling pos”

You’re absolutely right.  I’m a studio tracking/mixing engineer who has seen it all.  I absolutely understand the frustration of balancing passion and survival ($), not to mention success and relevancy.  

I also understand the need to adapt and see the lines between producer, producer, engineer, artist, studio, mgmt…. it’s all blurring together.  

I’m interested in making quick throw away skeletons of modern music and then using my own creativity and skill to take it from there.   

tl;dr: what are the best plugins that can auto generate melodic or rhythmic patterns and how far is this tech stretching?",1672936052.0,sirCota

104034f,Arpeggiation techniques,"Hey, does anyone have any advice on how to get good arpegiation patterns, or similar to arpeggiation, im not sure what the correct name is, but its between an arpeggio and a melody, very common in EDM, I hope people no what I'm talking about. Its something I find isn't explained very often in tutorials and YouTube vids.

Notewise obviously octaves, fifths, thirds and minor 7ths are the main ones. 2nds add a lovely sound, in place of the third something to get an ambiguous harmony, 6ths give a nice bit of colour too

then rhythmically like a 3 over 4 pattern is always the go to for me (play 3 note pattern eg, C, E, G, C, E, G.... but in 4 beat rhythm, hope you get what I mean) but gets over used and I get bored of it pretty quick

Anyone got any little tricks they would like to share, or certain note combos, patterns and rhythms they use or if they've found any tutorials on the subject they could share.

here's one by Protoculture, using an arpeggiator but im not strictly talking about arpeggiators, also just manual making patterns in a piano or something

I've pitched corrected and automated volume on vocal track using melodyne. The vocals have a subtle double-track through most of the song.

The song doesn't sound as ""full"" as other music I've listened to on the same setup. I've also done mastering limiting/compression but it still sounds a little quiet despite having a little clipping here and there.

I'm having particular trouble with the vocals though. Firstly, in the chorus, I am full-on belting the notes out; there is a lot of natural distortion to my voice which doesn't seem to come through; it sounds like I've sung quietly and turned the volume up. The vocals also don't seem to sit well in the mix. Have tried more reverb, less reverb, and various EQ and compression combinations, but it doesn't really seem to help.

The vocals are compressed at 4:1 and have a boost at ~500Hz and ~4000Hz for fullness and clarity.",1672922210.0,Srapture

For reference I'm super inspired by burial and I like to make similar stuff \[particularly his untrue stuff\] but I've noticed on that album and this goes for a lot of other music tbh the kicks aren't really THAT crazy or loud/low-end heavy it's just there establishing itself into the mix as a kick but when you view it as an average listener you aren't really looking for that, so I almost need to lower my barrier to entry with kick samples?? 

Maybe I just need somebody else's ear to tell me what they hear going on with some of my favorite drum sounds used in songs.

The balance of the song is off, for example I'll listen to my music in the car at volume level 40 but when I put on the songs that I lowered to make sure there's no audio spiking I'm cranking that song up anyway to 48-50 in order for it to sound just as loud as everything else it's incredibly annoying.

This is a decision that's took a long time to come to after lots of half-quitting it to pursue something more ""stable"", a view I had internalized from modern society and family perspectives. This isn't just a passion, it's the service I want to offer most to the world. I'm tired of being caught between ""follow your passion = never work a day in your life"" and ""If you make your passion your job you will hate it"". Live to work VS work to live is another example. I know it's not going to be fun all the time or even most of the time but I'm tired of squandering my time trying to learn new skills that don't suit me at my core.

To clarify, I have a Bachelor of Arts in Music. We've been told a million times how difficult it is, I'm not here to argue that. I'm not aiming for fame or fortune, but to build a sustainable, consistent, small business that scales until I can live comfortably.

While I am open to other adjacent career paths within music, I am aiming to become a fulltime producer or audio engineer. I would love to be a full time performing artist, but it's unrealistic to my circumstances and I've made peace with doing that as a hobby. I've spent the last roughly 3 years dipping my toes into the basics of it but struggle to produce high quality sounds. Progress has been made for sure but its apparent I could have made better use of my time, something I'm looking to do now.

I could go on and on about this stuff, but I'm definitely lost in many areas so I'd like to get out of my shell and start asking people what to improve. I've consumed SO MUCH information from podcasts, videos, workshops, etc. but most of these are soft skills or practices that are too advanced for the stage I'm at.

1039a5x,M-Audio Solo causing digital interference,"I have just bought an M-Audio Solo USB interface which seems to be causing a digital sounding hiss/high frequency distortion sound when connected to my Cambridge audio amp.

The hiss does not subside even when I change the amp’s input to a different device. I have also tried using the headphone output on the interface to connect to the amp but similarly there is a digital sounding hiss.

The hiss itself is responsive to my laptops functions: e.g. when I move the cursor the mousepad the frequency of the hiss raises and lowers.

I have tried different USB cables between the laptop and the interface. The RCA cables between the interface and amp can’t be the problem as running the headphone Jack into the amp causes the same problem.

The sample rates of my laptop and the interface match.

I want to record the output of my Pioneer XDJ RX3 over the UCA222 directly to my pc. In the future i might want to use my laptop to livestream the output of my rx3 and therefore i need this feature, besides the fact that the rx3 can record on a stick itself.

I connected the master output to the input of the UCA222 and connected the USB from the UCA222 to my Windows 11 Home Dell Laptop. The Behringer is shown as microphon in the hardware list andif i test it with the windows settings function it seems the get continuous input signals as it should.

I then tried to use Audacity to actually record the signal but there i noticed a very strange behavior and thats why i am asking for help here.

Sometimes it does not show any signal beyond a tiny peak in the waveform but if i reconnect the input on the UCA222 it always gets the signal for a few seconds as it should and than drops back to no signal. Randomly it gets the signal again for some moments. I was not able to record more than seconds continuously.  See: [https://imgur.com/a/dBDUBZC](https://imgur.com/a/dBDUBZC)

(the second wave block was when i manually reconnected the input wires)

I tried a windows recording app where i observed the same behavior (so i dont blame audacity, cause that works for all my other devices). 

There is no loose connections or damaged wires as far as i could test.

Does anyone have an idea? Is the device broken or what could / should i try next?

Eventually I managed to make connections that led to me playing guitar (my main instrument since I was a kid) for a pretty big artist signed under Columbia. We went on a few tours and a handful of festivals. I also met a few smaller artists and influencers that I did various sound engineering jobs for. I’ve saved money from all this which has allowed me to take some time off to just work on the craft, so to speak. Please message me demos I’d love to try and help out.",1672836110.0,Brilliant_Ad3564

Anyone familiar with Soundtoys bundle, or their pluins in general? Wondering if it's worth it. I like a couple of their plugins but everything is on sale right now and I could get the whole bundle for $240.

Not that $240 is cheap, but if I got only the ones I like it would probably be between $120-180ish, and I'd only get 3-4 plugins. I figure for just the extra $60, I get all 21.

But, this is how you end up with a ton of unused plugins over time, isn't it? Cus there's almost always some kind of ""for an extra $50, I get 10 more!"" thing to snag you. And I really don't like getting into the buy for the sake of buying habit. It's costly and wasteful.

Those who have/have used ST, how do you feel overall? I mostly just want Little Alter Boy, but in watching some demos they have some great options for saturation and some nice echoes.

Also FYI, everything is on sale until 1/5, for those who care.

102nyoa,Figuring out how to optimize outsourcing work to studio musicians,"Hello,

I'm currently using FL Studio, writing songs with my keyboard via midi input. For instruments that I don't play, I'd love to get better quality recordings and thus find a studio musician to record the part. For instance if I had a midi harp playing, I'd like to get that recorded live and put that into the track instead. I'm trying to figure out what would be the best way to go about doing this?

Right now my current thought process would be to simply do what I am doing with FL Studio, then export the midi file to Muse Score. When I've tried this, the notation looks super messed up. But let's say I take some time to get it correct, then I can send this to a studio musician (I found a few websites to connect with these types of folks). They send a recording back, which I'd then put into the project, and then mix/edit to taste.

Is there anything that I could do to optimize this process? This seems a little clunky, or slow. It looks like Cubase has a notation editor built in. Would it be worth it to learn Cubase if this is something I plan on doing a fair amount? How do you guys do this sort of thing? Any tips/advice is appreciated. Thanks!",1672790510.0,Ragear

102jfa5,tracks for an EP having all the same root bass note,"So I'm starting a new project after taking a bit of a break (not my first rodeo, have been producing on/off for over a decade / released tracks for streaming). I ended up writing tracks on a whim again and ended up with 4 beats that I really like and have written lyrics on most of them. I also ended up realizing I used the same root bass note on all the tracks. The tracks have mostly different key signatures and the tone of the bass is different on all of them with each being modulated very different, so it doesn't necessarily sound like the exact same note on all tracks, per say.

Do you think this would be problematic for the listener if most tracks on a 4 - 5 track EP had the same root bass note? Or am I overthinking this? Again, stylistically the basses are different and I don't think one would notice it right away (took me a while to notice it myself).

However, it would be *really* nice if I had access to essentially the same setup at home minus the acoustic treatment and mics.  Some problems I'm running into:

* Samples: I use Dropbox for things like drum samples and custom-recorded sounds, but some libraries like NI Komplete are way too big.  I could throw those all on an external drive or two, but sometimes the path will get messed up (NI thinks the library is at /studio/external/library instead of /home-setup/external/library), and if I correct the library path then the next time I go to the other location it won't find the libraries again.
* Preferences (key commands, templates, default instruments): Are these things you just have to remember to manually sync, or is there a way to keep these up-to-date at all times? Even if there were a way to say, automatically copy all the files to the cloud (intelligently, meaning it only does so if it's the latest version) then that would help a lot.
* Dongles: I know iLok cloud is a thing, but it seems like many manufacturers still don't support it. There's also the eLicenser dongle and (shudders) the Waves problem.  Is there a way to wrangle all of these short of purchasing a second license for everything, or do I have to bring the dongles everywhere and pray they don't get damaged in transport?

I will still rap/sing but I don't want to do the lame parts like actually making the music.

I know this is a very obvious and also off-topic question I could solve immediately by looking it up, but  I don't know what I'm doing and doing something myself is scary so I want you guys to tell me how to get people to do things for me for free.

How much money do I make? I'm a teenager and I just finished my travel year and my parents might get mad if they find out I haven't been doing anything since I got back last summer and I decided I want to be a singer. I don't need to be rich instantly since I still live at home but I'm tired of having to use my monthly allowance to buy things I want, so I want to passively make money from music.

I can pay the people making the music with exposure (I'll put their name in the title) but what do I do for the people making my vocals sound good and the ones who write the song? I don't think I can just put a bunch of names in every song title so I'm wondering if there's another way.",1672768767.0,HauntingSquare2313
102dzza,"Disentangling ""creative"" and ""generic"" song writing frustrations","So this may seem obvious to many of you, and probably more applies to those of you who aren't yet professional producers with the experience of building many successful tracks.

Something I have struggled with for many, many years is trying to write music that both ""sounds good"", ""fits a genre"", and satisfies my creative desires. I've always erred on the more chaotic/wild side of the production fence (as opposed to some meticulous producers who are more focused on perfectly mastering the sounds and techniques).


Almost always I'd find myself producing stuff that didn't work, because it was:

Too much raw creative intention that didn't ""make sense"" or ended up a clashing sound
or
Too generic sounding


My most recent realisation is that being generic and being creative are not opposed, rather you need to build a truely solid generic base, then apply creativity over the top/around this basis. An ideal jumping off point for creating is a tried and tested core.


Obviously if you inhabit a purely experimental space, this doesn't apply. If like me, you're trying to introduce new ideas to established genre spaces, the trick is not to avoid sounding generic. It's to make a generic idea and then apply new ideas within or between the generic foundation.


Conceivably you could start with the creative element (s) but I've found I simply get lost working this way and end up with a mess.



I guess the core of the idea is, separating ""good production"" from ""creative experimentation"", so that you're not trying to do two things at once. It also helps to anchor your wild fantasies in familiar tropes.

I hope this helps someone. For the first time in 15+ years of toying with music, I've started writing music I'm actually satisfied with, and actually finishing tracks rather than moving on from an 8-16 bar loop. All by pushing on with a generic sounding beat instead of tossing it out in frustration. As the creative parts come in, I will often revise generic elements to fit, but the framework is still there to hold everything together.",1672767227.0,cartesian_dreams

Mixed down an old song, went to export and couldnt find how? (Maybe its rust, idk), but then i just exported the tracks individually. Plugged into my laptop and then all of the folders were empty.  
  Not only are music and audio depot empty folders, but when i click instead of taking me to an empty folder it takes me to some broken link online?  This sd card should also have other songs on it from previous exports. But theres nothing. 
  The songs are all still on the sd, because i can access them from the tascam. I'm worried there's something wrong that's real bad though.  This is the exact same cable, computer and console i have been using forever (just not in a while)

I just set her up with a older dell PC laptop (all she could afford) and the only input is headphones.  She would like to be able to record on this laptop... and she has the following specifications.  


*""I need something external to plug my mic into, my earphones into, music thru(or whatever) and a program that has multiple channels, record and edit, simple auto tune, fx and reverb, frequency controls, can turn music into karaoke(take the voices out and leave just the music). You know, recording for dummies.""*  


So from what I gather from that is she needs something she can plug headphones, with mic into that will allow her comp to record to software with multiple channels (Im guessing stuff like main vocals, backup vocals) and then put it all together.  As the laptop has no inputs, there will probably need to be some sort of external device to USB to plug into.

I used to use Cubase, but I found Steinberg to be pretty unreliable in terms of technical issues and had a lot of trouble with the product. Mind you this was in 2017. 

Basically what I'm wondering is: anyone out there using Cubase, have you had good experiences with the software and company recently? And also: besides cubase, are there any more DAWs with both a simple UI and a good selection of vst instruments?",1672637117.0,baby-superhero

100l2sb,How to make pleasant sine wave chords?,"I know. It’s not hard to just load up a sine wave and make some chords, but mine never sound as crisp or pleasant as some of my favorite producers. Some examples of what I’m going for is the into to bon voyage by Droeloe or the intro to leaving by Ekali.

A pure sine wave gets something similar but never sounds quite as smooth. I’ve tried using a more distorted sine wave like the analog bd sine wavetable in serum which adds some more character but still isn’t it.

I’m think the spacing of notes might be playing a part here? Like if I play a normal triad the chord sounds a little too full. 

What are you tips for making pleasant simple sine wave chords?



Edit: So i achieved what i was trying to do by doing this:

Sine wave, Slight FM with subtle attack envelope. LP filter, subtle chorus, EQ, tiny compression, transient shaper to add a little attack back, EQ. Most importantly the chord voicing is ~2 octaves apart with 3 notes. Sounds hardly any different w/o the compression/shaper tbh. I also have a macro adding in another sine wave 1 oct higher which sounds nice when its quiet. Thanks for the tips.",1672584324.0,JoinMyGuild

I feel like I can make songs but i can never make a full song start to finish. It’s not impossible but garageband doesn’t seem good for learning how to make music, or anything other than just learning how DAWs work.

The only thing I could think of is that there aren’t enough loops that you can use to make a intro, verse, chorus, and outro with. For example if you just try to make a song with loops with one category selected (like house) you can probably make a chorus but not build up to it really using said selected category only. I can do this on logic pro i feel like.

I also feel like some of the instruments sound more like soundfonts than midi instruments. Like the hard rock guitar is just too intense to sound at least a little natrual

I was trying to program some drums to the song “Deceived” by Trivium. I was using Logic Pro but found it extremely difficult to use the piano roll for this purpose. To avoid having to input the all the notes by hand, I played in the notes I could and then was going to quantize and edit the remaining notes. This sounds good in theory but logic wasn’t accurately recording the midi from my kit and placing each note by hand is tedious while trying to remember exactly how the drum parts go. The kit I’m using is the Alesis Strike pro SE.

zz86bw,How to make metal drums less repetitive?,"I'm a one-person musician currently making a black metal project. I'm still a beginner with little equipment, so aside from my electric guitar and my voice, I have to program everything using a DAW. I only have one song out so far that I made with Bandcamp (lame, I know), but I've been familiarizing myself with Reaper. It's been a huge learning curve, but I love it so far.

I've got a track with drums (PerfectDrums VST plugin) and a mediocre bassline (SiBass VST plugin I think), both of which I used a virtual MIDI editor for. It's very tedious to do so but I'm actually quite proud of my drums, especially as a beginner. My issue is, I feel that it's very repetitive. I hope I can explain it properly, but it goes:

Intro + Blast Beat 1 + Blast Beat 1 + Blast Beat 2 + Blast Beat 2 + BB1 + BB1 + Tom-Snare Roll + Tom-Snare Roll + BB1 + BB1 + Kick/Cymbals Beat + K/C B + BB1 + BB1 + Roll + Roll

I think it's decent but that lasts about 20 seconds, and then I just repeat it over and over for the next, like, 2 minutes. Does anyone have any tips on what I should add or how I can prevent myself from making repetitive drum beats in the future, especially since the genre of music I'm making is very reliant on having exciting drums?

EDIT: I also want to encompass different subgenres in my project (such as industrial, shoegaze, new-wave, etc.) but with the main focus being black metal, so I'm a little unsure about how to do that. ",1672426156.0,Frysken

Here's a video really breaking down what's going on for me. I've even tried moving the sidechain trigger even further in front of the kick and upping the attack on the compressor just a bit in case that was making a distorted noise or something, and got varied results from that.

But you would think it shouldn't be this hard to navigate this, and I'm using the exact same compressor and settings as this video. Is this a logic thing? Is it just an unavoidable click that the compressor is causing this synth that causes it to spike? Plugin latency stuff? (I have plugin latency compensation on)

Am I missing something super obvious? Thanks for your help.

Is mixing in 'proper' terms just a myth? I find that whenever I go to mix properly, as in, mixing session where I strip and do all the right things like remove clipping etc, that my songs just become so much less. Sometimes I watch famous producers spend 30 minutes dialling in a reverb, but to me, these processes happen during production whimsically, emotionally... I mean of course, my music is not all clipping and has really fantastic dynamics (in my mind), but its just when I try to domesticate the song it sorta loses its life...

1-Quad track my guitars and use one Amp sim on each to combine different sounds (I'm using NDSP's Fortin Cali and Gojira, one on each quadded track, 4 instances total, 2 L and 2 R hard panned).  
2-Then I bus each track separately or by pairs to two auxes (L&R) and low cut and hi-cut them until I find the frequencies where the crispiness resides.  
3-I apply Decapitator to the auxes, I crank the Drive fairly high and adjust with the mix button until it's basically just noticeable.  
4-I then mix with the faders and the rest of the session in context to let the saturated tracks sit.

zxwf1k,"On a budget, want to get some gear - I have questions","I live in a sharehouse with somewhat limited space - not enough for a music room, anyway, unless I cleared some stuff from storage (but then those rooms don't have windows, so it's not ideal). I'm also a student on a budget.

My main instrument is guitar, but I can play bass well enough and some basic drums and piano. I have a 25 key MIDI controller, and this is how I've been adding drums to my tracks. However, I'm thinking of investing in two things: a full-scale MIDI keyboard, and an electronic drum kit. I do not plan to gig on drums or piano, so them being useful for practice or not is not an issue. I just want to know if these are worthwhile purchases for production, and if you have any recommendations for which to get of each? Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Logic behind downvotes on Reddit is a mystery to me, but whatever... thanks for the advice, the three people that commented. I may decide on some drums later, but for now, I have purchased a Yamaha PRS-E473, which is a nice affordable 61-key model. The extra low and extra high octaves are probably not needed.

zxvj8z,Do you have similar experience as me? (Collaborating with a business person dilemma),"I'd like to share my experience collaborating with a guy and hear what you guys think about it. I'd be just my complains and sound childish, so I apologize in advance. 

I'm an amateur music producer doing songwriting, arrangements, mixing and mastering. I've been making music with the guy who is a 38 year old man and used to play in the band. He gave up his dream to be a professional musician when he is 20's, now working in other field not related to music and pretty rich.

Luckily, he admires me and always cheers me like ""you can be a pro in the future, you are so talented. Keep it up!"". I appreciate his cheers. And in this year, he asked me to produce a song together. He can't do anything about music but making a melody. So he said he'll make a melody, music marketing and pay me and a singer who I hired for the cost (he has the budget though, enough for me), and asked me to do all other sings like checking his melody, make the construction of the song, arrangement, mixing, mastering and managing the vocal production with singers I hired. 

I was excited at this project because I can do more things I can't do myself, especially hiring a vocalist. Although, making several songs together, I was staring to his attitude to music. Honestly, his melody is usually messy that I can't make any ideas of arrangement and get proceeded to the next process. So I gave some feedback to him like ""you can make this note to this, it'll be better and memorable because of the music theory like this"". He said ""OK I'll try. I'll make some melodies so please pick up the melody you'd like"". But his melodies he sent to me didn't get improved even several months has passed and always sounds ""just made without thinking anything"". Honestly I 'd like him to ""try"" to make a better melody at least even if it's a bit of growth and takes more time, because I'd like to make good music with him. I know everyone has a different music experience and getting better skills always taking much much much time. So I'm happy if the person collaborating with is trying to learn and practice at least. I don't care about how high their skills to collaborate, but their attitude and enthusiastic to music.

He always say ""I wanna get the grammy"", ""everyone looks me down when I say I wanna get the grammy. But I believe I can make the dream come true as long as I say"". Although, unfortunately, his stance is still always like ""please pick up the melody you like"", ""I don't know about music theory or anything of details about music like you, so I can't do it"", ""I don't wanna take a time to learn and google about music"" or other things sounds like he don't keen on music. So it was like a music lesson that always gives him a lot feedback and modify his melodies to make them decent as a song. Sometimes he gave feedback to my arrangement and mixing though, his opinions is too ambiguous said ""I know I'm irresponsible and don't know what to do but you can do more"". As a producer, I asked some questions to clarify what he is thinking and find what to do. He didn't answer anything and I was thinking it's my fault, lack of my professional skills. Some of my friends said it's because he doesn't any vision for music, like what kind of music he wants to make, what's his music style, what his favorite music style, but just wants to get more ""numbers"" like views, streams, and money. Honestly I think they are probably right. Because he always say ""I'd like to make money with music"", ""I wanna provide a song to artists all over the world"", but I haven't heard any ideas that makes the song better and his strong feelings about music.

When the release date of the song was coming, I asked him about the music marketing like does he have any plans what service you'd plan to use to publish the song, what service for music marketing because he said he'll do anything about the marketing with his skills of marketing, which he is working in his full time job. But he didn't search anything at the time. He didn't even know the platform like Tune Core and Distrokid. Even he asked me ""how can we publish a song?"".

If he is just a marketer and don't make music, watching just the numbers is completely fine because their job is to make money and get more view or streams. Although I feel what he said is unrealistic for his efforts to make music and he doesn't seem not genuine to music. I'm sad that he thinks music just as the tool to make money and give him desire to feel ""I succeeded as a musician"". One day he said ""The Beatles and Michael Jackson did succeed just with their feeling. They are just lucky because they didn't have to practice hardly with their natural talent"". I got mad at what he said and my friends who I told about him did too. I don't know but he often excuse why he doesn't practice or think deeply about music by saying ""I'm already an old man so can't do things like young people"", ""I don't have any talent"" and ""I don't have enough music experience as other musician to succeed"".

What I feel sad and frustrated are that I don't have enough skills to be hired by someone and I can't hire people and buy things for music production without support from the guy. I understand it's my lack of my skills so I need to practice and learn more. And I appreciate him that he admires me and pay me for music production at least. Although just feel so sad that I haven't met people who keen on music so much and try to make our song better (and the best) together. 

I'm always wondering am I wrong, too picky and just hard to people. Complaining it here like this is so lame of me to begin with though...I'd like to ask what you think about my situation and if you have a similar experience as me. I'd be grateful if you'd be how you solve such situation.

Thank you for reading this until the very end even though it's too long. I'm too emotional these days. I'll get back to my learning of music production now to go to the next stage.",1672287747.0,K-Frederic

Recently I have been looking into groove boxes. Which is like ok that’s cool, however I am a bit confused I haven’t seen a lot of use of other music genres. Which honestly I expect a lot of the groove boxy type things are catering to the hip hop and edm crowd. However I am looking for a device that would allow me to try and do something different in terms of genere and I guess I have some thoughts on how to do that. One would be to use a sequencer kind of groove box to kind of sketch out the back track of the song and later import into a DAW and fully produce and polish the rest. However I do se ways I could maybe use the sampler type work flow as well to build up some of the other pieces of music. Now here’s where it gets really confusing to me I see that the novation circuit devices (tracks and rhythm) are really bang for your buck type of machines however I have heard that their integration into daws isn’t so good so they would just be really a sketch pad. So my question is what should I do should I get one or the other, or both? Or should I look at something different?

What I want is to cut up that file and make the master individual tracks. Now the question: in the CD days you could make a DDP file (I think that’s right) that would have fades set in. So if the song started with a cross fade, you could choose to use that or not depending on if the song was being played in sequence, or starting on its own. 

Distro kid doesn’t accept DSP exports. I cannot find any info about this anywhere, probably because I’m using the wrong terminology.

zxezg2,How to deal with meticulous perfectionism in musical project management? I keep running in circles,"I’m a jazz/instrumental composer (and attempted producer), and I’ve been working on eleven tracks for the past three years. I’m an obsessive perfectionist, and find myself very unwilling to release my music until it is perfect or very close to perfect. I’m finding myself constantly changing my mind with regards to who should perform the music, who should mix and master, and other things.

I wanted to hire freelance session musicians from online to play on my tracks, so that they’d have more of a human feel than the VIs. However, I’ve learned that Fiverr is not the best option for me, as the vast majority of the (15+) orders I’ve made have come back unsatisfactorily. This generally boils down to performers not playing with the expressive touch and phrasing I have in mind, playing rigidly and robotically even when reference material (piano recordings I made to indicate dynamics, supplementary to the sheet music I write) is provided. Sometimes, though, the performers are outright unable to perform the music correctly at all, but accept the money anyways. On a handful of occasions, I’ve paid people only to have them submit recordings that sound wholly unpracticed.

I then circled back to focusing primarily on VIs, resolving that it’s unlikely that human freelancers will be able to pick up on the nuances of my musical visions through asynchronous recording sessions organized through a budget freelancing site. In a large number of cases, these do the job well. I’ve had people tell me that they sound indistinguishable from proper recordings (particularly my bass, drums, and orchestra sections). However, there are a handful of instruments, such as saxophones, for which there don’t seem to be any satisfactorily lifelike software emulations. SWAM saxophones just aren’t there yet, IMO. So, at the very least, I need one or more human saxophonists.

Searching for human saxophonists led me to continue searching for other instrumentalists, as well. I do not think I need to hire a trumpeter because good ones are extremely out-of-budget and okay ones likely won’t provide anything usable (my music often wanders into the extreme upper range of the instrument). I’ve received quotes for human performances of almost every track on my album, and, on SoundBetter, the average price per recording hovers around $250. I’m a college student on a limited budget; I just can’t do that to my bank account.

I want to produce professional-quality music, and I think that I’m working healthily towards that point in my composition and arrangement, but in terms of production and project management, I’ve been wandering in circles, throwing money at the walls in hopes of a miracle for three years. This album has turned into a spending problem, which may soon tangibly affect my life. One of my chief life goals is to be a successful and renowned jazz creator, but in terms of releasing an actual product I’m proud of, I’m lost. And that’s not even touching on mixing and mastering.

2023 is going to be the year I release some music.  I have plenty of tracks ready to go - with 4 in mind as the first release.  I am not able to master effectively using Reason 12 - I do love the DAW and have been using it since version 2.5 - but it's not cutting it on the mastering end.

(As a white person) I can't help but notice that Black people aren't equally represented in all music - they disproportionally feature in music genres like blues, jazz & sould but are few and far between in rock, metal or normal, i.e. non-soul influenced pop. Similarly, you can rarely see Black people in contemporary classical or orchestral music. Even in strictly electronic music they're very present in techno or drum & bass genres, but almost absent in stuff like trance or EDM/IDM.

Why is that? Partially I'm sure it's cultura and social reasons - blues & jazz originated from and are considered ""Black"" music, whereas mostly european orchestral music is ""foreign"" to most Black people. But what explains electronic music disparities? Or rock / metal one?

It's hardly controversial - I hope? - that Black people are better dancers, so could some of it at least be attributed to different way they feel the rhythm & groove? That would explain preference for techno vs. very rigid trance, or jazz / funk vs. mostly simplistic rock / metal.

Ok, so this makes it sound like a music producer is an individual who is generally in charge of both creative and technical aspects of making music records and projects... However, I will hear people say things like ""I would rather spend more effort composing good music than spend more time producing mediocre compositions,"" ""You cannot outproduce a poorly composed track"", etc...

so recently I've realized that writing songs and making music is my meaning of life, that's what i should do. I'm 21 years old and study something I'm not really interested in, just so i do anything. Also i don't make any mentionable money atm, i make like 200 bucks a month from something i enjoy doing.

I've not been producing music for too long, (two years) but i know that's what i want since it gives me an immense sense of peace and purpose.

I know, making money off of my own music is gonna be hard as fuck, and tbh there's a pretty good chance i won't make it. But i want to at least stay in the industry so i keep learning and adding to my own musical understanding. So i came here to ask you guys on how to best start making money with my skills.

How did you start to get paid? My production skills aren't professional yet, but solid. So are my songwriting / recording skills. I also do a weekly course right now which ends up with a diploma that's called ""Certified Music Producer"".

There's not a lot of studios in my area, and I doubt they'd hire me with the skills i have so far. There's also zero job offers to begin with in that industry. 

So firstly: How do i find jobs in that area and how do i make them want me as a ""trainee""?

And secondly: What can i do in terms of freelancing / self-employment and what's the best way to do it? (writing lyrics / mixing for other people on the side)

zwjmut,please help with workaround for Tascam Model 16,"I just purchased a Model 16 after researching audio interfaces for my home studio.

In deciding which interface to get ,  aux sends and returns were high on my list -as well as being able to simultaneously record tracks because I use specific outboard effects to dub out my music as a perform it live ( and with midi sequences).Unfortunately,  even though I thought I had be thorough in my research, it turns out I was not. Unlike every other fairly well appointed mixing console I have used before, it seems the 16 has aux sends but lacks aux returns. This is disappointing but I'm wondering if anyone can help me with a work a around. 

My biggest stumbling block is that I would like to track multiple instruments at once and perform dubbed effects in real time in varying combinations. 

Of course, I could use one, or two, of the normal channels as a return but I fear that track turning into a gobble gook of all my effects from multiple instruments- kind of defeats the purpose of individual tracking and mixing. Meaning, I wouldn't be able to do much mixing after I recorded.

I could also use a Mackie mixing board I have that does have aux returns ( and inserts for 8 of the channels) and some how try to side step the issue. I haven't completely thought this idea thru because I think it would probably add a bunch of unwanted line noise, be cumbersome spatially and I'm not sure if I can send the aux effects individually with the inserts anyway ( in previous experimentation, I believe the inserts WILL send the track individually by using the tip, but I think it's pre- aux return). 


Before I start to rethink the way I build my songs ( and my purpose on earth), can anyone pull a helpful idea out their hat?

zweksz,Highly recommend listening to ‘Tape Notes’ podcast to learn how top artists approach making and recording music - I’ve found it so inspiring!,"This podcast is unbelievable and has changed how I look at creating music. It’s presented by John Kennedy, a highly regarded radio presenter in the UK who really knows his stuff - He sits down with top artists from all sorts of genres and they break down the creative and recording process for their most recent album.

They typically start by showing the demo of a track and then talk about it’s evolution whilst going through the individual stem tracks that ended up on the final album. Throughout the episodes they talk about their philosophy towards music making.

I’ve learned so much from the four episodes I’ve listened to. Here are a few key points from episodes I’ve listened to so far:


[King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - KG & LW](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WFe47tl9VlWuS36e7vdeZ?si=Bc17eTU9RCuZ4qR7FvFrmQ)

- Some of Stu’s demos are unbelievably sketchy and rough, and he doesn’t consider himself to be a great recording engineer. He prioritises speed. On one track they had a quickly recorded demo, EQd drums and then just overdubbed guitars.

- Record 2 takes of the drums with a mono overhead. Kick in the middle and then hard pan the 2 takes to get that signature King Giz live drum sound.

- They use a lot of stock midi instruments (e.g. flute, clav) that sound rubbish soloed but in the context of the mix add that extra sauce.


[Foals - Life is Yours](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4NL91DFEsNQNRYeFaXZTrc?si=N6-l1dnwTKO-WSWUWXVZww)

- A lot of talk about writing with little to no effects to make sure it was a great song.

- When they then jam with effects, they come up with a million ideas and unique sounds they want to use. Their producer would then set parameters and allow them to use a different weird effect for a  bar or two so it didn’t overwhelm and detract from the song.

- The sheer amount of vocal harmonies and doubling they use blew my mind - adds so much to the massive sound they get but I’d never really noticed it. This has completely changed the way I look at vocals.


[Jon Hopkins - Music for Psychedelic Therapy](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7u1zmrj96zZYG1CSLD3IZj?si=v7E8f9B3T8-2PE-nY3aMUg)

- Trust your intuition. Most of the time the first thing he thinks of ends up in the song. Talks a lot about serendipitous moments such as when he accidentally hit his beer glass that was in the key of the song.

- Uses space as an instrument. He’d send stems to his mate who’d then blast it out of some jbl speakers in a forest, record it and send it back.

- Combining 3 or more sounds to create one cohesive element. E.g. a piano pedal for transient, a mid heavy synth and a high synth. Also creates weird percussive elements by waving some kind of sheet. Each of his tracks soloed could be an ambient song on their own - he’s too good!


[Caribou - Suddenly](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WFe47tl9VlWuS36e7vdeZ?si=cQvaDiiWR4Gbg2fzYC2K7w)

- Probably my favourite episode as Dan Snaith is just such a nice guy. Doesn’t consider himself a good vocalist but knows his strengths. Recorded a demo vocal and piano track for ‘Magpie’ and then sped it up slightly to give it a higher pitched ethereal feel - so cool!

- Early in his career he wouldn’t sing lyrics, just gibberish and this would often end up on the record. He’s moved away from this but a lot of his demos use this technique to find the melody.

- Interesting relationship with equipment. He mainly uses plugins but for this album used Floating points’ studio and synths to add extra sauce. A really interesting point was playing the melody on ‘Like I loved you’ with a midi guitar plugin and occasionally doubling it with a real guitar - sounds so cool! He also ditched his outboard eq and preamp because he can get the sounds he wants in plug-ins.

- Timbaland’s idea of introducing a cool new element at the end of a song that then leaves the listener wanting more.


The common thread between them all is simple - they do what they enjoy, set loose rules / concepts for the overall sound and experiment a lot - I found it really inspiring to hear that most of the time they don’t really know what they’re doing, they just mess around and enjoy themselves!

zw5l2r,Can't figure out what the point of a volume envelope is? read this?,"So I'm getting into sound design, and one thing that really baffled me was envelopes and their role in designing sound. I knew, technically, what they did, but as far as applying it to sound design in any meaningful way, I was kind of clueless. 

Here's the best way I think I can describe it. With an envelope, you are using these 4 parameters to literally shape the waveform. You've seen a waveform in your daw right? Maybe you've seen a kick drum. In a kick drum, if you look at the waveform, it starts it with an almost instant burst of volume, then ramps down and ends. With an envelope, that's what you're making, your designing what's called the transient, and then your designing what happens AFTER the transient happens. The attack is going to be the first part of your transient, it's how quickly the sound bursts in and reaches its maximum volume. For an 808, you would want a relatively quick attack, because you want the sound to smack really fast. 

The next knob is the decay, for a long time I was really confused between release and decay, I couldn't figure out the difference. The decay is how quickly the sound is going to decrease down to the sustain volume. So for an 808, you would have a relatively quick decay, because you want that quick burst of sound, you don't want it to stay at max volume for too long. You want that quick burst of sound, then for the bass to play. 

The sustain is how loud the volume is going to be after the attach and decay has gone by. When we are shaping sound, it's very valuable to be able to have something play at a lower volume than the initial transient, for an 808, we want a loud initial transient, then a lower volume for the actual bass sound. So we would turn the sustain like maybe halfway or 2/3 of the way down. Remember, the sustain is going to be related to the master volume of your patch, so it doesn't mean that turning the sustain down is going to create a weak sound. It's just how you shape the sound.

The release is how quickly the sound is going to fade to zero after the key is released. For an 808, the release time can really depend on your preference.

To get the hang of this, get a waveform out, and pay attention to what the transient looks like, see if you can identify what that sound would look like as an envelope, because you are essentially shaping the waveform with the envelope, so learning what different waveforms look like can really help you in dialing in the right envelope for the sound you're going for.

zw586u,A Question About Purchasing Ableton Live,"So I've recently started music production and my buddy suggested Ableton Live. Got my free trial. Loved it. Just ran out yesterday.

I want to buy the standard version and I was hoping to use their split pay option, but some of the wording and examples and stuff like that seem super contradictory. 

It reads as if it puts a hold on the full amount and that can't be spent, dispite it not being a charge. Which seems pointless because then why bother with the monthly payment aspect of it.

I'm just confused with how it works and am wondering if anyone has any experience using that payment method and can explain it.

Does it just charge you per month and check that you have the necessary balance for the full product each payment, or does it actually put a hold on that amount and it can't even be spent before that next payment?",1672111213.0,Oobledocker

* Great-feeling keys. Fully-weighted piano-action keys preferred, but semi-weighted keys that feel fantastic to a pianist are ok as well. (Nothing that feels mushy or springy.)
* High-quality hardware - everything needs to feel solid and durable
* MIDI-assignable controllers - in addition to the standard pitch bend and mod wheel, I'd love a few extra controllers such as a 2nd mod wheel, touch-sensitive ribbon controller, X-Y pad or joystick. I don't need a ton of drum pads, faders, rotary knobs... I don't find those particularly useful. Something that can gracefully add continuous controller data (with my left hand as I'm playing with my right) is what I'm after.
* If it does require driver to get the best of it, the software needs to be native M1 and fully compatible with Ventura.

zv4c14,Plugin for visualization of frequency-panning space throughout the track,"First of all, I'm pretty new to all of this, so tell me if the question makes no sense and there's a better way to do it. A lot of videos about mixing show a visual representation of a song (frequency-panning space) and tell you how you should put different instruments in different places inside that space so that you would have a clean and wide mix. Problem that I have is that I usually have too many instruments throughout the mix and it becomes hard to keep track of when trying to clean it up and put every instrument in its own place. Is there a plugin that shows you how that frequency-panning space is filled so that I can for an example: see that I have too much empty space during verse 1 in  10 - 12 kHz on the left speaker and fill that with ambience, or more importantly: see that I have too many sounds that occupy 14 -16 kHz on the right speaker and maybe pan one of them more to the left. I understand that you should be able to do that just by listening, but if there is a plugin for visualization it would help me a lot. Also, I'm using Fl studio so if there already exists something for that inside it, you can also let me know. Thanks!",1671995255.0,PickleOk7987

zuzrue,Versatile DAW for me?,"Hello!

I'm a guitar, bass and keys player who doesn't have much luck with bands. I decided to make some music on my own. Currently using Reaper, but I'm looking for something more versatile with nice built-in instruments and effects. Don't get me wrong - Reaper is great, but it doesn't come with any instruments, and effects are ugly and not inspiring. It has a reputation of being great to work with audio, but not so much with midi 

My main styles are rock, funk mixed with some synths. But I'd also like to try composing/scoring fir a film. Like orchestral stuff.

I also tried Ableton because I like the idea of looping my guitars on the fly, but to me it didn't feel right for a main studio DAW. It wasn't very comprehensible after Reaper. I got Launchpad mini, but any other Daws are good for live looping real instruments?

Another feature that I'd like to have is nice chords/harmony tools. I saw Cubase has nice features like audio chord detection, chord pads etc. I know intermediate music theory, but these tools seem to be great for reharmonizing and giving different taste to your song.

I have to say that I'm still working on improving my timing, so audio quantized would be nice to have.

Apart from that, goof sounding effects and maybe instruments. I don't care about guitar amp VSTs because I use Line6 Helix, but I think I need decent FX for mixing, mastering and maybe instruments. I do not need huge samples Library. Maybe only drum beats.

Also need something like pitch correction.

I love looks of Reason, but many people say that it lacks many features. On the other hand, everyone talks about lack of support for VST3, but not many other drawbacks are mentioned.

Cubase and Studio one seem to be really feature rich, versatile and suitable. 

Mixraft is not very popular, but on paper looks great. It has performance panel, seem to sound OK on YT videos, has built in Melodyne, it has all features for audio editing top I guess and works nice with MIDI as they say.

There's also Bitwig but don't know much about it. Also not much about Cakewalk, but it's free and has all the features of Sonar Pro as I heard!

What would you recommend? I would like to try two, max three Daws, master it and make music. I don't really want to waste too much time for trying and learning software. Would like to choose the one that works best for me.

zujorf,MIDI sounds good while playing; upon playback its offbeat (Logic Pro X),"hey everyone,

I’ve been going absolutely insane trying to figure this out.

While i’m in the process of recording on my midi, everything sounds great and is on beat. But upon playback, everything is completely off time. Im definitely not imagining it, and it doesn’t have to do with me playing badly, as i even recorded a voice memo on my phone picking up the track WHILE i’m playing vs when i play back the recording, and it sounds wildly different.

im on low latency mode, adjusted recording to delay to match my buffer size, and even tried switching MIDI Controllers (I usually use a Nektar 88 key, but went back to my little 2-octave AKAI and it has the same issue).

Is this just a matter of needing a new computer at this point?


Additionally (a less pressing concern, but still) the synths themselves sound a bit different too during playback vs recording (i know oscillators are supposed to randomize to give an organic sound each time, but it sounds quite worse and less rich— quite noticeably so on things like 808 bass).

At this level I just try to make beats, basslines, chords and some melody but nothing on making them sounds better or the way that I want to sound. But I'm still learning. 

During this learning process, I came up lots of times term of ""Active Listening"". I'm trying my fav tracks to deconstruct ( on my level of course) that's why I'm trying to listen actively. But my problem is: I just hear some sounds but I couldn't name it clearly like this is pad or this is some whoosh sound or this is hihat etc.  I know these tracks we listen have lots of effects but still I think I should've put some tags of that sound and I couldn't/can't.

zse6kc,Questions on gear for getting started to make and produce music,"I would like to get started making and recording music, specifically electronic (I think?) music. I currently play guitar and bass and have a way to record that. I've always held off on recording anything fully created by me since I can't record (or write or play lol) any real drums and I've been into alt rock, shoegaze, and thrash metal for most of my life. I've written songs on my own with just guitar and bass and recorded covers of songs before however. Recently I have been listening to a lot more modern music with drum machines and synths and such. Trench, Minecraft Volume Alpha, KIDS SEE GHOSTS, Plastic Beach, and To Pimp a Butterfly are the main 4 albums I've been listening too. Anyway my question is about what gear I would need to get started making music (on my own) that sounds something like these albums, mainly Trench and Plastic Beach since I can't really rap (and can sing). I currently have 2 guitars, a bass, a guitar amp, a pedalboard (with reverb, delay, fuzz, phaser, and distortions), a Volt 1 audio interface, E906 mic, M40x Headphones, and a Desktop PC with Reaper (the infitinite free trial) installed. I think I need a drum machine, sampler, possibly mixer, and keyboard or synth (I plan to learn gow to play one very soon, within a week or two). However what else could I need, and what of models of what stuff should I get. I would prefer to spend less than 400-500 dollars on all of this. I would also like to know what plugins and such I could use for mixing the music after (if possible to fit into the budget). Thanks for reading all of this lol

zrd29r,Do music producers really gatekeep?,"(TLDR: I feel like music producers do gatekeep because I notice a huge difference in the quality of professional music relative to the available tools and resources we get for them)

This topic has been going over my head for a while now, and because of the number of crystalline mixes I've listened to in the past few months, I really have to ask myself this question: **Do music producers gatekeep?**

Before I go into depth what I mean when I say this, I mean, music producers ***perhaps*** having a secret group of connections amongst themselves where they continually develop their sound in order to improve the quality of their mixes. Or it could be that one is good friends with someone else who has insane samples (which either are or could be previously borrowed from another person itself) or presets or effect rack presets or anything and decides to share them for support. 

It could even be music production techniques which are in fact extremely effective, but isn't shared on e.g. YouTube. But is this really a big deal? What's so hard about approaching this improvement with the lone-wolf method? Well obviously it is mainly that I have a sound library that already sucks, because I have quite a narrow view of where to look for stuff, and to make a good sound from sounds that suck can be extremely time-costing and especially strays me away from actually making songs.

So obviously I am not certain whether the above theory is really true or not, but it can definitely be certain that there is a really significant disparity in quality between the sample packs which are provided for our music production and that of the music from the professional producers we know of, which is indeed why this question had been boggling in my head. Why is this disparity so huge? Why is it that (for example) drums from sample packs, even from paid ones, are either extremely distorted, badly EQed, or badly compressed/limited, when such of those from professionals sound perfect in context of the mixes they make?

Obviously the reason is because of post-processing right? Maybe there are samples that seem either terrible or non-directional when you play it by itself until you actually apply effects to them, which may have been used by professional producers. Post-processing definitely helps in most of the circumstances rather than not using them at all. 

However, I see those FLPs and Ableton tracks and the samples list and then I see all those samples starting with 4 capital letter initials and those production tutorials (how to make \[something\]) and I just see producers drag in already refined/polished samples in and it sounds effortlessly amazing. Minimal effects applied, as they boast ""less is more"" on samples that already have ""more"". I even see those professionals themselves livestream their project breakdowns, and when they explain their sounds, they say something around the sort of ""oh I got this from \[XXXX\], credits to / shoutout to him"". Like, where do I find them? Where can I find them? I search for these 4 capital letter initials + ""sample pack"" and random junk which has those initials in the title of those websites come up, as if it doesn't publicly exist, yet I see millions of project playthroughs somehow have them.

One could argue, samples are 90%+ sound design, and sound design is free for everyone, especially with awesome synthesizers like Vital and Surge, and with enough fundamental knowledge, can have maximum control over the morph of their sound. This argument would then become ""it's not that complicated, you just aren't good enough"", even when they probably didn't need to do things the hard way because they have connections that could supply them exactly what they want. 

So now I ask this question again, **do music producers gatekeep,** or is it me that's the problem? Do I just have to be a bit more outgoing to producers and kindly ask for better samples? I personally like to work alone, as I am quite an introvert and social interactions are sometimes a difficulty for me. Moreover, I only produce music because I enjoy it, not because I want to be apart of a ""producers community"" to the point that I have my identity basically defined as being part of something than just being myself.",1671605955.0,leahciM78

zqiejl,My gf made a somewhat hurtful comment about my interest in music production and I'd like other opinions,"hi there,

yesterday I was rambling to my gf once again of how I love music production and teaching myself the stuff even though I ain't that good at composing, etc.

She lost patience and replied: ""you're 30, why do you keep entertaining this fixation, be realistic, you can't *sacrifice your life* for something as low-reward as your music aspirations, your never seem happy about yourself, let it go, focus on things you are more talented to,"" etc. What hurts is her saying I'd rather *sacrifice and not live my life*, assumedly to cling to a pipe dream.

To an extent, she's kinda right. I'm often found slacking at my job because I rather watch music production videos, and I am lonesome, meaning that I don't engage in the usual social stuff like birthday parties, new year's eve parties, holidays, etc... Well I do it to keep my relationship going, but I wouldn't do it on my own because I see that as distractions from the main goal. This attitude might bring me some trouble in life, but I also consider it's my own choice.

She also says that if I was serious about that, then I'd take a 4-year tuition in a conservatory with clear goals, and make a career. Which I simply can't because the money and energy investment is high, and I don't even want an academical career, I ain't no cello player, choir leader nor music teacher, my pleasure is simply programming midi bars on a DAW. She says I should have in-person classes rather than online classes (skillshare) because those online lessons would be ineffective. But as I'm living expatriated, finding the right lessons in my language or at least in english is a pain.

At this point, I don't know how to balance my desire for teaching myself music and living a somewhat normie life. I hate the idea of coming back from my job and having nothing to create. I prefer to create my shit musics, even if they're never going to be recognized as such, at least I'm trying...

I also believe I really fucked up the part in life where I'm supposed to surround myself with like-minded friends, obviously.

I don't see myself earning money from any musical skill of mine right now, but I think with some consistency I might just be able to sell bits and bobs on fiverr in the next 5 to 10 years, after all I'm interested in sound design presets, and I have a good baritone voice. Of course it's no superstar career, but if I can add 100 or 200 dollar monthly to my job salary one day, that's satisfying too.

If anyone can recommed online teachers or quizzes that could assess my potential and test the knowledge I've already erratically built, I'd be grateful. I don't want to let go of this part of me, even if it is a mistake.

thanks,",1671522915.0,eyewave

I guess his first idea was to just do multiple takes of himself singing, harmonising with himself.

Although we're probably gonna try this idea too, my advice was for him to do a proper recording of an actual acapella crew. 5 people singing simultaneously, each with a close mic and also a stereo pair in the room to make it more a natural and interesting version of the song.

If he's up for hiring some professional singers it's no big deal since we're bound to get a decent take sooner or later.
However, we're trying to budget the whole thing and the best thing would be to have a few friends sing, musicians that do have the ability to sing but are not professional, so pitch could be an issue. He himself is not the best singer, kind of off pitch and not the cleanest voice, especially on higher registers.

I've been doing this for almost 7 years. I've been using regular PC's which currently perform below what is needed. I never did mixing and mastering until recently and it was at that moment when I realized I needed something more oriented to music production as my regular PC started to give me problems: It freezes, the program doesn't start, strange and annoying sounds are attached when play directly from FL Studio. In summary, my PC is not made for those kinds of tasks. I've noticed those problems appear when I use pads on my tracks and when I used plug-ins such Sausage Fattener and Soundgoodizer, again, when it comes to upgrade and give more power to the sounds from the stems I already built.

After what I exposed my question is simply: which PC do you recommend? I don't care if it is desktop or laptop. Please, take in account I'm not a professional, make this for fun as a hobby, I don't need the ultimate PC, just something that doesn't crash and let me reproduce the steams and final track with all plug ins.

zpgit2,DAW’s similar to Garage Band for Windows? Struggling with FL Studio.,So when it comes to recording my guitar into FL Studio I find myself really struggling with the workflow and honestly just really hate working in a DAW in general so hoping maybe a different one might be better for me. 99% of the time im just recording a mic on my guitar cab to a metronome or recording a cool synth idea using outboard gear. The guys in my band have macs and use garage band and it seems super simple for passing ideas back and forth and recording takes to send to our drummer who does a lot of the arranging but I don’t have a mac. Any recommendations for a DAW that is pretty brain dead when it comes to just recording live instrumentation for PC?

zpgbmh,Going to uni for music production/technology?,"Ok so Ik this isn’t the right place to be going for career advice but I’d like to hear some views which aren’t the classic responses to this question.

Taking into consideration the way the music industry shifts constantly and the next set of producers are much more different to the last with the whole “bedroom production” and doing research about studying I see very opposing opinions.

The one thing I mainly lack is a “platform” to push my music - either connections or a following ETC so Idk about the whole “buy the equipment instead of wasting the money on the degree” response because my music could be out of this world but we both know I’ll probably be consumed by the other 100k songs being released daily on Spotify.

Currently I’m taking a year out after my A-Levels (making an album and going travelling, working ETC) 

Ultimately my end goal is to be a highly successful Artist/Producer. I’m aware of how much of a long shot that is but it’s what I enjoy most and it’s not like the music scene is going to be the same as it is now in 10 years.


The unis I’ve mainly been looking at for music tech/production/sound engineering courses are LIPA, Surrey, Birmingham City, UWE Bristol and I can’t find any high ranked uk unis with music tech courses as most don’t have it and there’s no rankings for music production unis or anything like that so these are what I found overall to be the most competitive and rewarding. 

Lipa seems pretty washed up for creative musical talent in recent years but still seems like the most likely I’ll get picked up if what I’m doing is actually great quality and Surrey has pretty good graduate wage perception stats but doesn’t seem like the type of path to be going down when I want to be a Pop/hip-hop/R&B/jazz artist? And do I really want to be in Guildford 🥴🤢

I just want to make music that can gain an audience who appreciate my work. 

Does anyone know any decent ways to “pitch” my music to people? (I’d maybe add some songs onto this post if people asked but I don’t have any fully finished recent works past my A-Level Music Tech as I was more meaning what should I be doing for my future recognition)

Please comment what I should do! I’m so clueless as to my next step and I’m not trying to sit at home every year failing to reach any listeners and having to work at a restaurant or something!

I have a couple industry contacts but it seems like no one wants to place bets in this abundance of new talent.",1671419457.0,EggieBeans

I’ve seen pros use both in videos, like ""Creating vocal stacks with Kuk Harrell - Mix with the Masters"" without an added center vocal.

My initial thought was that a center take in the stack would compete with the lead vocal (unless performed differently), and should only be used for a different effect under the lead (e.g. like ""Isaiah Rashad - Modest"")? - am I right in thinking this?

As an artist, I’m trying to gather whether spending time on recording & comping an extra take (with no panning) in a vocal stack is necessary in most cases. Or should I just stick to hard left-hard right vocal stacks?

By working and seeing videos of mixers in the job, I have seen how they decimate tracks with disproportionate amounts of compression, EQ (specially lots of high end!) and/or distortion-- the amount of reverb does seem to be conservative though-- i have seen compression meters go all the way through and EQs maxed out

I think the problem seems to arise because such courses strive to be general and universal, incluiding all kinds of styles like classical, jazz or world music.

Someone told me that I should absolutely give to granular synthesis a go, others that I should buy a sampler like the Roland SP404. Others said I should buy a korg minilogue with granular plug-in.
Any piece of advice? I am honestly clueless.

zo2bms,Left monitor not working properly,"Hello,

&#x200B;

So I am not quite sure if this a question to be asked here but this has been bothering me for quite some time. I have KRK RP 5 Rokit monitors and been using them for about 5 years. Now I believe I have the wrong type of cables for the monitors, even though the do work. I think I read somewhere that if you use the wrong type of cables that, yes, they will work, but they will add nasty hissing sounds (or whatever you call it). But now to the problem itself. My left monitor sometimes doesn't play any sound or it plays it really quiet compared to the right monitor which is working just fine. Sometimes I just manage to solve it by wiggling around with the cable connected to the left monitor indicating it might be caused by the cable. Whether it's faulty or just the wrong type of cable, I am not sure of. Also sometimes I manage to solve the problem by cranking up the volume from my audio interface. It's like you have a stuffy nose and then you just blow all that nasty stuff out and then your nose clears up and is normal again. Like I just crank up the volume during a playback to about 70-80% quite fast and then the left monitor starts working again.

&#x200B;

This is really weird and annoying. Any advice what could be causing this? My guess is that I am using the wrong type of cables but if that is indeed the case, what cables should I be using for these monitors?",1671267847.0,JedApe

zmsfex,logic pro latency hassle with multiple external midi instruments,"Hey all

I am coming from years and years of stubborn Reason usage. Since I got an M1 macbook though not everything is going fluently and I also had a hard time getting it to talk to my midi controllers. 


I´ve been exploring Logic for a while and overall it´d been a pretty exciting experience. I am still running into several issues however. Mostly regarding latency.

I´m running a couple of hardware synths as external instruments and as my project grows latency starts becoming an issue. Even when I disable most effects. It doesn´t seem to matter much. I think I will need to approach projects a little differently, but there is one thing that annoys me hard. 

When I enable low latency monitoring, some of my hardware synths play ahead(!) of time! So kind of reverse latency. I guess logic looks ahead to the midi notes. There is an option to ´auto-compensate´ and sometimes it works to enable it, or disable it... it´s all depending on whether I use low latency monitoring etc. 
But then when I set e.g. an 8 bar loop, things really go on the fritz when it goes to the starting point. Things will run great for 8 bars and then stuff goes out of sync again. 

I gues I could circumvent this issue by adapting my workflow but it just seems so weird to me that this is such a hassle.

zmqhfp,Setting Up Simple Beat making and synth rig with old laptop,"So, I have an old Dell laptop that still runs ok, and I have an Arturia Minikey and a DrumBrute. I'm wondering if, with these three things, I could make a recording setup for making drum beats with a little synth in the mix. 

It would be really cool if I could use this as a live rig, although that's optional if doing that would be a lot of extra work/money.

I'll be playing fuzz bass/guitar over the beats, so I'm thinking I wouldn't need too much in the way of programs. I'm thinking I could run Reaper, use that to load my soft synth and maybe a drum VST if I'm not satisfied with the Drumbrute's sounds (assuming I know what I'm talking about.

What mics did they use and what techniques?


All i know is that Eddie Kramer said they all played it live/at the same time w the exception of when one of them plays multiple instruments on one song
And that they kept the mistakes etc in for character


I've also read that john bonhams drums used the Glyn John's micing technique


Jimmy page used his supro amp and telecaster for alot of solos (especially early zeppelin era) but also other amps but favoured small amps in the studio to easily make them distort


John Paul Jones
His bass somehow always sounds so huge (this part is the one I'm personally most interested in)

He used his 1962 fender jazzbass with rotosound 45 flatwoundson most early recordings
His main amp Live was the acoustic 360 but I'm not fully sure if thats what he used in the studio

I believe his amp was miced atleast most of the time since you hear some vibrating in example dazed and confused and other songs
Some songs also sound like he has a leslie on like heartbreaker but dont quote me on that
(Not sure if he DI'd? But i feel like he partially did since the bass sounds so huge)

I dont know alot abt his keyboard stuff tho other than the diferent keyboars he used and that he sometimes used a maestro Phase shifter at times


As i said earlier i dont know what mics they used so i cant say alot about Robert Plant



Im not really sure what studio equipment they used
But i believe they used a neve1073 preamp?

After some research I learned that this setting is basically an EQ that increases lows & highs for some volume levels, and that it makes my mixes sound better pretty much because my mixing sucks... skill issue.

The thing is I'd really like to know the exact filters/eq settings/etc. of SONOS's loudness setting, or at least get some more details on it. Anyone who knows more about this, or has documentation on it by any chance?

zmheh5,60's mono production,"Hi everyone

I'm back on a 60's rock binge, and just love the power of these mono recordings so much! How can I emulate this in modern daws? 

My main concern is : should I mono everything? Like put Ableton utility (or J37 mono) on every track and every group or was there actually some stereo going on? When I read about how they recorded I understand that there was like 3 mics on drums, one or two on amps, and ambience most of the time. This will give a stereo recording... Are all these mics then summed in mono? 

Listening to Cream Disraeli Gear or Sgt Pepper or first incarnation of Pink Floyd the mono versions always sounds way heavier and more powerful, but I also understand that trying to make mono with stereo was obviously going to sound bad (those damn drums in the left ear only).

Also, stupid question but was song going into the console then into tape then back into the console or something else? You have to keep your recorded tracks so it was obviously on tape soon but that sounds like a LOT of tape haha",1671098096.0,SrirachaiLatte

zm9ssh,Help with guitar latency in FL studio,"Hey everyone, figured this may be a better place to ask than the guitar subs.

Basically I’m just trying to use FL studio, or even a stand-alone app, as a guitar amp simulator. It is just easier for my current situation, to make practice more accessible.

I am currently using a real tone (rocksmith) cable and experiencing a little latency. I believe my pc specs are fine to run a plugin or 2 and not experience latency, as they’re just free plugins and not that intense, and I use my pc for much more intense things on the regular. I have it set to the best settings I can (6 ms) through FL.

I’m using FL ASIO for the driver, as asio4all doesn’t seem to allow me to use the real tone cable as an input. 

From what I’ve gathered it’s an issue with the sound card, so I thought making the output my DAC may help, but there’s still a little latency. Is there any way to get this perfect or close to? My understanding is even if I get a cheap interface and use it for the input and output, that should get me to where I want to be (as close to no latency as possible.) does that sound right? Is there a fix with the real tone cable that I could do, or should I just get a usb interface and use it for the input and output?

after making most of my beats from scratch without any prerecorded loops from the internet, I recently stumbled upon some loops in a sample pack that I want to use for future projects. After trying to start a beat based on a loop I encountered the problem that I have no ducking clue which chords and single notes are played in any given loop. The individual notes might not be so relevant as only their key matters but for chords I think it's somehow important to know which are played as my bass line and further chord layers as pads/pianos sound kinda off if the chords are way off even in the same scale.

I mean I could try out every of the 7 chords of a scale for every single chord played in a 4bar loop but I thought there me more methodological and better solutions to my problem.

I'm using Logic Pro 10.7.5. and I have a basic understanding of music theory.

Great, now obvious I shouldn’t compare myself with experienced people right? Not until literally every person I’m friends with who sucked more than me or even just STARTED quickly rose to the top and leaving me behind.

I can’t take it! So what did I do? I crammed in billions of music production tutorials, copying them step by step, hoping to get some good sounds and knowledge and experience. And so I learnt how to make sounds, yet I still don’t even find purpose in them nor have the ability to relate them to a real track. I tried suffering myself to only produce for entire days.

Have been mostly looking at Novation, Arturia, and maybe MPK controllers, and notice that reviewers who are more seriously into synths and production really seem to value the 5-pin MIDI out and sequencer functions. They don't appeal to me at all. I'd rather either pay a bit less or get other functionality instead, but maybe my preferences are only a small percentage of the customer base?

For those of you who newer and treat this more as a hobby than a profession, do you use the sequencer and midi out functions?",1670974388.0,AndrewSonOfBill
zl96z6,What is in a loop/sample pack?,"I have been looking into making loops to sell, but I'm not sure what people expect a loop pack to have in it.

I guess my main question is what is the standard template/expectation for a loop pack? 

also, bonus question: is there a significant difference between loop pack and sample pack? Or are those terms interchangeable?",1670970733.0,WrathOfBongs
zl8nxt,Upgrade audio interface vs buy a Pre-amp?,"Upgrade Audio interface vs buy a Pre-amp?

I am currently looking into upgrading my home studio. I am using a Komplete audio 6 mk2 as my main interface and (before it broke for the second time and I've decided to never use it again) an ART Tube MP Studio as my pre-amp. Now the built in pre-amps in the Komplete audio 6 are not bad but they are a bit dull for me, however I really grew to like this interface, but the pre-amps in it won't cut it for me so I'm struggling to make a decision. 

I don't have a lot to spend on these items so what I'm about to mention IS the target price range. 

So I've been looking at the the SSL2+ for a while now however I need 4 ins and 4 outs minimum so it wasn't an option up until now with the **SSL12**. I really like it however for some reason I feel If I'm ever going to upgrade my interface I want an interface that I can grow into sort of, you know something that will future proof my studio such as the: Audiofuse Studio, UAD apollo 4x, Antelope stuff. However those are way out of my budget right now, and would be pointless at this stage of my career. So I feel like I might regret the SSL12 because it wouldn't bring that much to the table my komplete isn't already bringing. 

So I thought about buying a pre-amp and I'm really drawn to the **Golden Age Premier PRE-73**  Based on my research it sounds great, I like the air switch on it, and I like how DI guitars sound through it. Problem is the future is kind of unpredictable, might have to move around, a lot of on the go production, so an external pre-amp wouldn't work in that scenario. I know this isn't a life changing decision, however I'm in a spiral and can't think straight so I need outside opinions.

So which one would you prefer SSL12 vs Golden Age Premier PRE-73 ? 

I know this whole thing is subjective but I'm really interested to see what you would pick, or if you have a little time, your thought process. 

Thank you in advance!",1670969504.0,Papauss
zl8j4w,What instruments can you use to overlap notes in a MIDI clip and get the slide up/down effect.,"I probably sound like a dumb dumb but overall I’m relatively new to music production, started some years ago but took a little hiatus and just recently got back into it. I love the effect you get from overlapping notes in a MIDI clip to get a sliding effect from one note to the other and I’m just trying to figure out what instruments or type of instruments allow you to do that. I know you can’t do it with all instruments but I was just wondering if there’s a way to tell what specific instruments will garnish that effect or if there’s a certain characteristic or type of instrument that does that. Maybe a way to add the effect possibly. Any help would be appreciated, much love.

I need help and guidance. I’m trying to sing and use my voice in my productions but every time I record my voice and put it on my beat it sounds bad. Outside the fact that I can’t sing for shit, I feel like the recording itself sounds bad. I have a Rode NT1-A mic, a rode XLR cable connected to a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 3rd generation into my computer via usb. I use Audacity to record the vocals because in FL Studio it has a weird high pitch noise that gets into it and I didn’t try to figure out what was happening. I then export the voice recording in WAV and import it into FL Studio. 
There is a couple of songs so that you can give me your opinion and some maybe hardware or mixing/mastering advices:

zl77a3,Reference track analysis (metal),"Hi music production friends!

I've been trying to up my reference track game, and have done some analysis on a set of songs in the metal/rock genre which I thought may interest some of you.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

I'm primarily interested in the loudness, ""loudness range""\*, and tonal balance of the tracks. The process I followed was:

* Rip the songs from Spotify (with loudness normalisation disabled);
* Crop a typical ""Chorus"" and ""Verse"" for each track;
* Run the full track, chorus, and verse through YouLean Loudness Meter;
* Crunch some numbers to work out things like values used for normalisation on Spotify, ""loudness range"" etc;
* Run all the tracks (full, and choruses only) through iZotope Tonal Balance to generate target curves for the set.

&#x200B;

**Observations**

* The songs are mastered louder than I thought they would be, with most choruses clocking in are -5iLUFS.
* There's a lot of variety in loudness ranges between the tracks, some managing 25 LU difference between the quietest section of the song and the chorus; and one < 6 LU.
* Tool - Pneuma manages to achieve the loudest chorus post-Spotify normalisation, despite being the quietest mastered chorus, thanks to the track's many soft sections.
* The spread of tonal balances is MUCH tighter than I was expecting when considering only the choruses. The ""rock"" target curve preset in Tonal Balance Control suggests a much wider spread than I observed here. I'll definitely be mixing/mastering my tracks to fall within this tighter limit from now on.

&#x200B;

**Figures**

[Tonal balance across all tracks (broad- full tracks)](https://imgur.com/BuwC3Gm)

Hope this is useful for some of you guys! I'd strongly recommend getting together a custom set in your genre to help with mixing/mastering. I'm now one step closer to my tracks not sounding like garbage!

I'd love to know if anyone has done anything similar. I'd also be interested in knowing how I could do something similar for stereo width, (or any other metrics I should be looking at).

&#x200B;

\*A note on ""loudness range"": I find the metrics available in the YouLean plugin don't quite give me what I'm after in terms of measuring a song's ""dynamic"" or ""loudness"" range. For each track I ended up calculating two values:

1. How much greater the Integrated LUFS (iLUFS) for the Chorus is than the iLUFS for the Verse
2. How much greater the iLUFS for the Chorus is than the Short Term Loudness of the quietest section of the song. (The quietest section being identified by hand, ignoring silences and fade ins/outs)

Bonus tip for those who got this far: I also calculated how much to adjust each track for mixing, such that the Chorus of each track clocks in at -22iLUFS, making it easy to compare like-for-like during mixing. I also created a group in Ableton with each of the Chorus sections aligned, and the same for verses, with the appropriate gain reduction applied so I can drop the whole thing into any project and solo them easily.",1670966167.0,heyjupiter123

i was planning to apply for the Jazz Studies program at the City College. then realized the school also has a Sonic Arts program (basically, music production). i started thinking maybe music production is more relevant for my goals as it is more directly correlated to making money.

however, a lot of people are saying you can learn everything on your own and a music production degree is not necessary for getting jobs at all.

what is your experience? is it worth it? which of these disciplines would i benefit more from studying?

10a045x,Is this PC any good? Thanks for looking.,"Yep, it's another post asking for opinion about a PC for music production. Sorry. I'd really appreciate it if someone who knows their stuff tells me if I'm barking up the wrong tree or not. As you can probably tell, I'm on a very stingy budget and this tower is refurbished.

From my very limited knowledge it looks like the CPU and RAM are sufficient for music production that I do (which generally doesn't include things like 10+ VST instruments running side-by-side, or massive multi-track recording projects). But I am wary that I might be missing something.  


One thing I have no idea about, is this type of PC easily upgradable/repairable, should something not work well, or I need some more powerful components down the line?

108xlhz,How do I send stems from my DAW to a live sound engineer during a performance?,"Asking here because I've been having a tough time finding the right answers on my own, and really need help.

I make electronic music and plan to do more performances this year. Already have one lined up in a few weeks so I need to figure things out on the technical side ASAP. I'm running an Ableton session on my laptop on stage, which will play: backing tracks, click, and instruments played in real time on a MIDI controller. Separately from that, I will also be singing, which will be processed by a vocal effect processor (TC Helicon Perform VE), which can go directly to front of house.

What I've done in previous performances is have my interface connected to the laptop, and send a stereo mix to front of house, but have the click just going to my headphones which are also plugged into my interface. I'm not happy with this solution and want to improve things.

I heard that sending separate stems for different instruments (like separating drums, bass, etc) is preferable for live sound engineers because they can have more control over the live mix. This makes sense, especially since my vocals are being processed separately from other sounds, and also due to every venue having different acoustics.

I already know how to send different tracks virtually in Ableton's Session View to different outputs, but haven't managed to figure out the gear side of things...I have a second-hand 1st gen Scarlet Focusrite 6i6, which is supposed to have 6 outputs but it actually only has 4 TRS outputs and 2 SPDIF ones. I don't know anything about SPDIF but I think all TRS would probably be preferable for consistency. I might be wrong though, but either way I'm having issues with Scarlet Mix Control (the software that comes with my interface). I just cannot get it to send different stems out of different outputs. No matter what I try, it always sends the same thing through both outputs 1/2 and 3/4. My suspicion is that the software just sucks, but maybe I'm missing something. So even though I have a TRS output 3/4, I haven't used them live yet, which is why my previous performance attempts were just a stereo send.

I will probably need at least 5/6 usable outputs: stereo percussion, bass (stereo or mono), and stereo everything else. Probably also need one for mono click track if I invest in a proper in-ear monitor setup, where I'm getting a full mix of everything from front of house. 

How do I do this? What gear do I require? Can it be done with a normal audio interface or do I need a special mixer of some kind? Is there anything different about interfaces for studio Vs live use?

1087la2,Would a sample pack that comes with the samples in a Kontakt Engine be more interesting?,"We have a few sample packs and are developing a Kontakt engine to house most of our samples. When buying packs or libraries, is a Kontakt engine important for you?

We're doing it because we're also music composers and it's definitely faster to browse through sounds that are loaded in a sampler than to do it through finder. However, the Kontakt development is a little harder than we anticipated, so we decided to ask and see what other thought about this! Here's the library we're building this for, in case you're interested.

If I want to view all frequency collisions in Insight 2 for example, I have to insert a case of Neutron on each track \[forfeiting the ability to see frequency collisions between two oscillators on one synth patch (Will phase correlation meters be able to detect phase cancellation occurring within one synth patch?) 

But I don't need to the same to measure any phase correlation? How would a phase correlation meter know whether a signal that has reduced amplitude is due to phase correlation or just by sound design? (For example, some kick waveforms might look like 2 signals with phase cancellation)

107kaae,Learning Music Production in 2023 - A Roadmap,"Want to learn how to produce music in 2023, but have no idea where to start? Here's a roadmap I put together for anyone starting music production. In my opinion, this is how I would approach learning and improving your music - hopefully it is useful to some of you. If you have any questions, comment below or send me a DM.   
    
**Step 1: Choose a DAW:**  
Logic and Ableton are my favourite but they all mostly do the same thing, just in different ways. Each with strengths and weaknesses. Most DAWs will offer a free trial so try a couple out and see what clicks.    


**Step 2: Buy a basic set up:**  
Assuming you have a laptop / desktop that has decent CPU, RAM (16GB recommended) and Storage (500GB recommended) then a good pair of headphones is probably the first place to start. Audio Technica M50s or Beyerdynamic 770s are my favourite pairs on a budget. I’d also look to get an audio interface if you want to record external audio like guitars or vocals. I’d suggest getting at least 2 inputs. SSL and MOTU make extremely good quality interfaces at a low price. Even if you don’t record an instrument or vocals, it will also be better for listening than the built-in soundcard of a laptop or desktop. I suggest good headphones over speakers because the acoustics of your room could skew your monitoring decisions. I'd also add a midi keyboard to your set up pretty early on even if you aren't a keys player. It will help a lot with the process. You can pick up many types of 25 key keyboards for under $100.   
     
**Step 3: Learn Your DAW:**    
The basics can be picked up from youtube videos, forums or from tuition and courses. (I also teach production between composing or mixing production/library music.) This is the order of things I would learn things in. Obviously, an EDM artist will want to learn slightly different concepts to a singer-songwriter and the process will be slightly different, however this is the way I would approach it generally:

1. How to record midi.
2. How to record audio.
3. How to edit midi.
4. How to edit audio.
5. How to use samples and loops.
6. How to use synthesizers and software instruments.
7. How to use effects to improve the sound. (EQ, Reverb, Compression, etc.)
8. How to arrange a track. 
9. How to mix a track.
10. How to master a track.

There is quite a bit to learn within each of these steps, but that is the order I would go in and structure my learning.    
**Step 4: Get feedback:**   
In order to improve, it is important to get feedback on your completed music from friends, family, forums and ideally professionals where possible. Anyone’s advice can be helpful though, particularly in the beginning. Obviously, stay true to yourself, but listen to what others have to say and try applying their advice.  


**Step 5:** **Improving your weaker areas:**   
Common problems I help my intermediate students with are:

* Not being able to finish tracks - therefore I would look into arrangement.
* Not being able to get a professional sound - this mainly comes down to sound selection, mixing and arrangement. Mixing is a huge topic in of itself and can be extremely frustrating to learn.
* Running out of ideas - learning some music theory can help with this, taking a break, and listening to some different music can all help here.

**Step 6:** **Seek more feedback:**   
Repeat Step 4 basically until you achieve your musical goals. You can’t get better without constructive criticism so you do need to put yourself out there. It can be scary at times but it will make you a better producer.    


Hope this helps some of you! Cheers, Adam.",1673285410.0,adammillsmusic
