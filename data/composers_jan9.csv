107hfj5,minature series,"Over 2022, I wrote about 30 little pieces for solo piano. I find it very satisfying and helpful to my process to constantly finish little things in between my larger projects- it helps me stay organized and keep composing.
Stay tuned as I'll be releasing one little miniature recording a week on youtube for the next few months!
This first installment is called ""Madrigal"" after the old italian vocal tradition. It's a tender little thing that I think is appropriate for this time of year! It's dedicated to my old composition teacher at Peabody, Michael Hersch, and is a sort of hommage to some of his music.
Hope y'all enjoy!

Are publishers companies or people? Do I need to find a person, almost like an agent, to find work for me and get my music out there? Or do I register for a company?

I have so many questions on how ASCAP works but I should leave that for another post. For now I'll just ask... what is ASCAP? I cant figure out if its just a registry for royalties or if its a way to get music published as well.",1673278386.0,US3RN4M3T4K3NH0W

I was happy with this composition. I came upon the text kind of randomly and it felt very appropriate for a concert that was on the theme of ""From Dark to Light.""

Would it be possible to do so with only a classical guitar at my disposal? I know many would say just learn piano, but it’s physically impossible to fit a piano/keyboard anywhere in the room I’m renting.

I’m not sure how much they cost as well, but I’m somewhat sure I’m too broke to afford a decent one.

I’d also love to know what type of music is composed in these times, my knowledge of modern music and composers is quite limited.

Edit: To add some reasons for which I asked this question:

1 - I’ve always heard you have to know how to play piano to be able to compose, that it’s the composer’s instrument. 

I, however, learned music later in life and don’t want to have to spend so much time learning another instrument before I can start rudimentary composition. 

I would like to learn it as I go on however for sure when the time is right.

2 - I’m not interested in composing solely for guitar, but in general orchestral composition for all instruments.

I learned guitar mainly because it was convenient with a lot of web resources and how cheap it was to get into, but I’m in love with music in general, not guitar music only.

I hope the above makes sense, if not feel free to tell me where I’m wrong, I’d love to learn.",1673116341.0,cyphr0s

So, this is a piece I've been working on for about a year now....Not steadily, I would walk away and stew for a while from time to time lol I've had the sound down for about four months, but been working at getting the notation at least close to readable, imho. I hope you enjoy this piece and please let me know, critiques and criticisms are appreciated!

Overall themes of this piece revolve around expressing the struggle between dual natures, within ourselves, our social groups, our beliefs, and so on. This is meant as catharsis, not necessarily inspiration or instruction. This theme is emphasized with the continual use of counterpoint. I try to restrict this to left hand vs right hand throughout, but I'm a guitarist, so piano players, let me know where I'm off, but be gentle lol 

Note on difficulty: This is meant to be a DIFFICULT piece. Some sections may be easy for intermediate/advanced players, but this should not be approached as an early piece of repertoire. Piano players, I would greatly appreciate feedback on the real level of difficulty. If you learn this one, please let me know and share your vids playing this! That would be great!

MVT I - Discovery

This movement is meant to encompass the feeling of exploring and learning, academically and socially, literal journeys and adventures that we all go through emotionally, if not similar experiences.

MVT II - Sorrow

Here, we've learned Truth, and it's hurt, bad...feel the pain!! Seriously, I love this movement. I've struggled with depression for a few years, and last summer was an especially difficult point in my life. This piece of music kept me alive. Obviously, I'm biased lol but I'm absolutely enthralled with this one, I hope you enjoy!

MVT III - Triumph

Originally titled ""Victory Through Acceptance"" but that's a little wordy and yeah, not cool lol But that's what I'm trying to express here. It's a bouncy piece that accepts the hazards of the past, resolves them into itself, and floats away, free.

105351f,The Mountain Path - Ys inspired music,"Hey fellow composers,

I've been trying to broaden my horizon since I need a wide variety of styles as a soundtrack composer and so I wrote a few pieces in the style of the Ys soundtrack.

For those who don't know: Ys is a long running game series by Nihon Falcom. Japanese Action RPGs. The music blends orchestral/classical music with metal and rock. Some are just orchestral, some are just rock/metal, some are a mix of both.

Since my attempts went so well, I decided to put together an album for Bandcamp. A mix between music inspired by the Ys series or a tribute, if you will and my own style. I already have a few pieces and this is the first one that ventures into metal territory. I've never done that for video game music, so this is a first but I'm quite satisfied with the result.

When I'm back at my workstation I can use CSS and Ministry of Rock 2 by EastWest to make it sound really good. In order to write it in Dorico, however, I had to resort to the Halion library. The guitars sound surprisingly decent but the strings are horrible.

Anyway, if you know the Ys series, tell me, if this fits the mood of the soundtrack. If you don't know it, I'm still grateful for feedback of any sorts.

Enjoy!

104p1vd,Toogle pause-note: Note input in engraving software,"Dear community!  
I have always wondered about note input methods. All the software options out there (Dorico, Musescore, Sibelius, I am excluding Finale here) have a similar approach to it. They introduce a special note input or ""write"" mode, which one has to leave with the escape key.  For me, this does not make sense in any of the programs, because I do not see the advantage to just navigating the notes with the cursor keys and making changes to pitches and rhythms. 

Also, they do not allow to input notes without knowing their pitch. As a modern composer pitch is just one parameter of many and this focus on pitch and traditional music is so disturbing these days. (as in designing a car engine and the software always asks: and what color has your car? what color? color first!... it is so childish :)  


This is the reason I installed an old Sibelius version again, where you can toggle a rest to a note and  just write in peace... and fast! (it is especially Dorico to ask for so much user input, that a fast and hustle-free note input mode is prohibited).

The video is shot, and to speed up the process my goal is to play the basic musical ideas I have on a midi keyboard rather than writing out the musical notations.  Is there any software that would allow me to play the midi part without specifying a tempo, then after it is done go back and tap a key where each beat so the software could then create the notation for me.  I remember doing something similar with Finale long ago, but it required me to have a metronome going and then playing to the clicks.  I want to play for the action in the video which means the beats will be varying throughout the music, which is why I need to be able to go back and lay in the beats.

Recently I've been giving a hand at composing for other types of ensemble, like Full Orchestras, and Concert band. I started out from not know what an Oboe was, to having a general idea on what each instrument does.  But when I attempt on working on one, it's like I burn out midway. Run out of ideas on how to develop further, like I ran out of composition juice or something for that individual piece. 

I'm starting to think that I'm simply just not ready to advance to that sort of level yet. Or is it just a mindset thing with composing stamina? Should I just stick to writing solos and such until I feel like  composing string orchestra is as easy as drawing stickman? (Obvious exaggeration, but you get the point)


Edit: Okay I have read all of your responses and here's what I've taken.

The goal of the community will be to have a place with a variety of skill sets and be able to get together to share ideas, receive feedback, and look for work/teams for projects.


As of now, the server is pretty barebones, and I am looking for people to help grow it with me, and give feedback on what is needed. As we get more members I hope to build an environment where people have a network they can lean on going forward in their creative careers/hobbies.


I am looking for members who are willing to help grow the community and provide feedback on what needs we can fill. Even if you are not interested in joining the community I would love to hear what resources you wish you had in an online community either now or possibly in the past.

1021xki,Aamulla varhain (Early in the Morning),"Hello all,

I have recently made an arrangement of the lovely Finnish folk song, Aamulla varhain for SATB choir: https://youtu.be/-mqECnNE5cg

Please, have a listen and provide any feedback you want. There are probably mistakes somewhere, and it’s always nice to have a second pair of eyes (ears?)


The lyrics in Finnish are:

Aamulla varhain kun aurinko nousi, 
Kun minä unestani heräsin.
Sydämeni oli niin surusta raskas, 
Miksi sä kultani hyljäsit mun.
Sydämeni oli niin surusta raskas, 
Miksi sä kultani hyljäsit mun

En minä tahtonut uskoa lainkaan
Noihin silmisi sinisiin.
Mutta kun tie oli ollut niin pitkä, 
Monista murheista lupauksiin.
Mutta kun tie oli ollut niin pitkä, 
Monista murheista lupauksiin.

Yö oli kaunis ia äänesi hellä
Kaiken nähdä sai uudestaan.
Riemuiten annoin ma sieluini sulle, 
Miksi sitä et huolinnutkaan.
Riemuiten annoin mä sieluini sulle, 
Miksi sita et huolinnutkaan

Miksi sä hyljäsit toisen tähden, 
Miksi mun uneni loppua sai.
Sydämeni on nyt surusta raskas,
Kun sinä kultani hyljäsit mun.
Sydämeni on nyt surusta raskas,
Kun sinä kultani hyljasit mun.


Translated into English (very) roughly:

Early in the morning when the sun rose, 
When I woke up from my dream. 
My heart was so heavy with sorrow, 
Why did you abandon me, my darling? 
My heart was so heavy with sorrow, 
Why did you abandon me, my darling? 

I didn't want to believe at all 
To those blue eyes of yours. 
But when the road had been so long, 
From many sorrows to promises. 
But when the road had been so long,
From many sorrows to promises. 

The night was beautiful and your voice was tender 
You could see everything again. 
Joyfully I gave my soul to you, 
Why didn't you worry about that. 
Joyfully I gave my soul to you, 
Why didn't you worry about that? 

Why did you forsake another star, 
Why did my sleep end? 
My heart is now heavy with sorrow, 
When you, my darling, abandoned me. 
My heart is now heavy with sorrow, 
When you, my darling, abandoned me.

Thanks a lot :)

(It's just the musescore export for now, I don't want to mock it up for real until I'm sure the composition is done.)  


This is a character theme for the creator goddess in my in-development indie game. The OST version here is in basic ABA form, but in game it will simply loop ABAB as long as it needs to. The A section is a compound period melody with a very homophonic texture, but the B section has more interest and movement between voices. Not quite polyphonic but I'm not sure what you'd actually call it.  


I wanted a sort of classical sacred music feel to reflect the nature of the character as a holy figure. The cadences are definitely very classical but the harmony leading up to it is not so much I think. Also I don't think the voice-leading is very classical, it's too smooth and not interesting or intricate enough (mostly similar and oblique motion, too little contrary). I do like the sound of it as it is, though - does it still need some adjustment or is it working as it is?  


Thanks so much for your time!

Firstly, there were a lot of string specific sounds like the continuous harmonic glissandos that were hard to find suitable analogs for within the winds. The repeated asynchronous passages were not too hard to notate, but were very hard to get to sound good in the audio rendering without sounding too robotic.

I think I struck a happy medium and am pleased with the final results. For some reason, the video didn't render properly (I'm still very new to making and editing videos lol) but hopefully it's not too distracting!

I'd appreciate some feedback so that I can have some more things to work towards this year.

It's a great way to learn, especially from those who have more experience than me. I'm working on a major project. Without giving too much away about what it is, I had the idea to use click tracks help with three points: logistics, sonic thickness, and consistency. 

The orchestra is going to be what I consider very large, so I'm looking to use click tracks to save space on stage if it ever gets performed live, God willing; including having space for a full SATB choir, with six vocal soloists at the front of the stage.

The second part is that some of the instruments, which while not uncommon as such, might not be available to all orchestras who may wish to perform the project, which is some 35 songs in length. This is where the consistency angle comes into play.

As for the sonic thickness part, I'm using six different synthesizers which need to be included in the click tracks regardless.

With all of this figured in, do you have any input yea or nay about click track usage for such a large project, or for a project in general? I hope that I didn't ramble too badly when writing this. Many thanks in advance for your help, and even just for reading.",1672558209.0,SLC-Grizzly

zz79pn,"Final Reminder - Two Days Left on the Large Scale Composer Poll — 12,000 votes submitted and almost 1,500 composers mentioned! — Who are your favorite Composers?","[Find the Poll here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxXI2Ag4ai2bm1ATguas2WdDCag2MZesGONVT4O8ttqBqiHg/viewform) there are about 2 days left in this poll which has been running since August 22nd.

I have reached my goal thanks to all of you with getting one thousand people to respond to this poll. This is the final reminder to give any who have not yet participated to let us know their favorite composers in the unique order they wish to submit them. As I have access to the each list, I can say with certainty that there are no duplicate lists, every single submission has been different!

This may not be an easy task so be sure to take the time to properly format your response as well as follow the rules of the submission process. So far only 8 submissions have been removed for various reasons (numerous repeats in lists, spamming the keyboard, including Squidward Tentacles, not meeting the required minimum number of submissions (5), &c. 

By my rough count, almost 1500 composers have been mentioned, which is more than the number of people who have participated, so the likelyhood you will add a composer to the 1500 is high. Any composer is welcome no matter how obscure, you never know if you may be the first one to include that composer and get their name recognized.

Results will take a few weeks to compile, as there are a few different charts and ways of counting the data that I have entertained to take on. 

This has been a truly rewarding project and I hope to continue my polling on Reddit about that different and numerous dimensions of this fantastic artform, and while those future projects may lack the volume of this one, the enthusiasm that I see in my DMs means quite a lot.

After [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/ye6zct/classical_symphony_in_c_minor/) where I submitted a symphonic movement in the ""Sturm und Drang"" classical style, I tried to use some of the feedbacks to come up with another piece as a composition exercise. There were a lot of good remarks, so I focused primarily on the tonality changes and the overall coherence with a recurrent theme between sections. I also worked on transitions to make them smoother even if I am still not completely satisfied. The ending is a bit abrupt making the final section very short but I may work on it again in the following weeks.

[Score (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TTQP35EvpP8jtK6vrtBKCZt-b6daQt3C/view)

The title of the work is derived from the artistic statement of Belgian artist Dmitri Likissas:

*""I consider each colored dot to be like a person. You and me and everyone. Together we all make up that image shown. You will notice that in my work all the dots are spread out evenly in a grid. The grid stands for me as for rigour and rules of society. I could have easily made squares instead of dots, but squares are not free, squares can not roll, but dots are free and can roll. Personally, I don’t want needless rules, I want freedom. However, some basic rules are needed, exemplified with this grid, which shows that together even though we are free (dot can roll), we can create an image if we follow basic rules. So creating these works besides being tedious, I am constantly fighting the rules to be met (the grid) because without the grid, I don’t get the image. From close by, dot by dot, it doesn’t tell you much, however from a distance, the colored dots blend together and makes you see something totally different. So, together, with some rules, we create a wonderful world. I also aim for the people that see the work to be amazed that at first glance they didn’t see an image. That they have to pay just a little more attention to the basics.""*",1672412465.0,RichMusic81

I hope you are doing well and had a lovely Christmas/holiday. 

I just wanted to share the latest single release from my upcoming album ‘This Too Shall Pass’. The album is a musical journey through my experiences of living with bipolar, including a suicide attempt and subsequent electro-convulsive therapy to recover. 

This track is the second on the album, and was written after I made an attempt on my life and ended up in hospital - I was trying to capture the feeling of despair and loss of hope that comes with severe depression. The album will hopefully be fully released next month, and $50 of all album (and single) profits will be donated to mental health charities focusing on crisis support. 

 I hope you enjoy the piece (as strange as that feels to say).

I assume that being too literally repetitive is one way to make a bad theme and variations, as is only having a couple variations. A Mozart-style construction where each variation is self-contained and played with a pause between each is probably also not exactly a refined technique today.

zxlgw4,Icescape - landscape piece for orchestra,"This is a piece I wrote to depict the feeling of standing alone in an icy field at night. I live in a relatively sparcely populated area, and it can get quite cold here in the winter. The second half of the piece, after the short episode in the strings, is almost identical to the first half, but it feels lighter in character due to all the minor chords being turned major and vice versa. This was also the first piece I've written using MuseScore 4 and the new sounds are pretty good! They've definitely helped my music feel more ""real"".  


The piece is nominally in D major, but it very quickly modulates to D minor and then is further altered from there, until the string episode occurs and we end up back in D major, which is where the piece ends. Also, I've been listening to a lot of Bruckner lately, and there are traces of that influence in parts of this piece, I think.

So basically, I've been working on an Orchestral piece lately and recently I've been thinking that since it's in the Sonata form how about me making it the first movement of a Symphony and then follow it with other movements.
I'm pretty happy with my melodies, the harmony, instrumentation and etc. Problem is, I chose 78 BPM for the tempo which is nowhere near anything anyone would consider ""Allegro"". And even if I double the length of the notes and double the tempo, it'll be ""Presto"" or at least ""Vivace"" which still won't work.

What should I do? Can I go with the 78 BPM or do I have to go ahead and finish it and call it an independent piece of it's own? I'd appreciate some help!

Just some background: I have taken lessons a few times over the years, but I never stuck with it longer than a few months.  I also abandoned music production due to work for quite a number of years, but now I'm able to devote some time to it, so here I am.

So, is there any program suited for this scenario (meaning I'm not interested in learning specific pieces but how to compose, play chords in different keys, transpose, try to an what's in my head, etc.)?

A little fugue on ""Happy Birthday"" (a tune which is now in the public domain) in F, for Recorder, Oboe, Clarinet, Basson, Orphicleide. Tuning is an extension of the diatonic Passion scale (7537573) in 37edo (based on F).
The extension is got in the following way: first, the diatonic Passion scale is constructed, and its tones are named F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E, then it's extended to 12 tones by adding B, F#, C#, G#, Eb at a distance of +3\37 from Bb, F, C, G, D.
This gives the following scale:
C	-	0\37	-	0
C#	-	3\37	-	97,2972973

zuhzn9,Dynamics,"I understand that some composers select different dynamics for different sections or specific instruments of the orchestra due to wanting a specific timbre, wanting something to be more in the background than foreground, wanting something to be more prominent or less prominent, or wanting something to be more restrained/forceful

The question I always go back to is “How do they know?” If the orchestra will balance itself what’s the point in doing different dynamics for each section? Wouldn’t you want everything to be heard equally?

I understand that one shouldn’t treat dynamics as if they’re a volume fader, but it’s hard not to in certain circumstances such as in a choir w/ orchestra arrangement. I don’t know if I’m overthinking here, but I used to mark the orchestra one dynamic below the piano and the choir because I wanted the piano and choir to be more prominent but I’ve learned recently that this isn’t good since the orchestra will balance itself. I also used to mark the brass one dynamic level below the strings. Again, I was probably overthinking.

ztel1c,Musical Moment no 19,"Here is the latest of my original compositions for piano solo. I chose to call them musical moments, a suitable name for smaller compositions. They are written in the style of classical music, romantic period.

This composition has a rather loose structure. However, I can perceive it as a coherent whole. I would say that measures 1-29 form the introductory part, measures 30-71 form the main part and measures 72-97 form the ending part.

I hope that themes are enough interesting to keep you listen until end.

I would say that the instrumentat that I'm more comfortable with is the piano, which i am using in order to compose some of my ideas, but i feel that my skill has lowered due to not playing as i used to.

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. Just about 800 people have responded with over _one thousand_ unique composers in their rankings! Given this fact, it is likely you will add a composer to the roster of those already mentioned. If you have a composer you feel deserves more recognition, this is the place to put them for all to see! You never know if you may be the first to mention them. I have wanted one thousand participants for the project since it began and we are about ⅘ to that milestone! 

To clarify for those who haven’t come across this poll yet, this is _not_ to rank which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : the instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked well. (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) Four submissions have been removed for submitting spam and or improperly formatted votes. _Please no P. D. Q. Bachs or Squidward Tentacles._ Given that the list is analyzed as a single entity, such submissions disqualify the entire list. The link above describes this process in more detail.

Share this around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect more reminders throughout this last month as the poll begins to close down and responses recorded. Upvote if this is something you’d like more petiole to see. Coming up will be the Four Month Update, One Week Remaining Reminder, and Two days Remaining reminder. Poll Ends December 31st at 11:59 CST.

zo5ug5,"I wrote a winter-themed choir piece with text by the scottish poet Robert Burns - ""Up In The Morning Early""","# Program Notes

*Robert Burns* supposedly wrote the poem *Up In The Morning Early* as a statement of his dislike for the Scottish winter mornings back in the seventeen-hundreds. I wrote the piece for my local youth choir, and imagined that this frustration Burns penned so long ago was something that would resonate well with the members of the choir today.

In addition to Burns' words, the music is inspired by British carols and modern nordic choir music. The words have been preserved in their original Scottish language, and so this is a true mixture of Norwegian and Scottish culture and influences.

zo1miy,Listening to scores is a huge part of my life. Is it possible for me to become a composer?,"My main concern with possibly becoming a composer is that listening to score music is such a big part of my life already, how could I come up with unique music without drawing on the massive library of music I’ve already listened to? 

Obviously I wouldn’t intentionally copy a piece from Brian Tyler, but how can I not unintentionally incorporate elements from music I’ve already heard? With such a large volume of music that I listen to daily, and how important that music is to me, how could I hope to create unique music when the music I love plays in my head all the time? 

I’ve created one or two action pieces in my head over the course of my life. I don’t know anything about music, don’t know how to write music, but these pieces weren’t derivative at all. The catch is that I was wasted when I “composed” these tracks. 

But it did reveal an appetite to compose music. I could see my love of score to be an advantage, but I think the downside is apparent.

zni3al,The best software for my process? (off-tempo improvisation into piano reductions into composer-friendly notation software),"I'm having some difficulties with my current setup (Studio One 2 Professional, Notion 4, Finale 2014.5), and since my approach and goals have changed quite a bit since I purchased it, I'm reconsidering whether it's still the best software for my workflow or if it's time for an upgrade/crossgrade. I'll write down my particular idealized workflow below and it would be awesome if y'all could help me find the best way to realize it, or a least approximate it. TL/DR at the very end of the post.

**ONE:** I'd usually start with some sort of free classical improvisation (mostly using my MIDI keyboard with VSTs, sometimes live instruments). In most cases, I'd play without a fixed tempo, even coming to an occasional halt when I need a moment to think ahead. While I'm improvising with the keyboard, it'd be helpful to see a ""unrhythmized"" notation of the last 30 or so note pitches/chords I'd been playing.Then I'd often record a second or even a third track, improvising over the first improvisation.

**TWO:** In the next step, I would listen to the result, repeatedly, marking parts where something interesting had happened. Ideally, I can now directly look at those parts in the shape of a grand staff notation and quickly separate the left hand from the right hand, and also unite the three different tracks into one piano reduction, perhaps showing the different tracks as differently coloured note-heads.Since I'm playing so off-tempo, the note values would of course be ridiculous, so I would need one of two options: Some kind of AI that manages to approximate a sensible score OR the possibility to ""punch in"" the musical metre afterwards (by playing it back and repeatedly pressing a key where the accents fall).

**THREE:**  In my dream software I could now press a button that loads all of the selected sections as multicoloured piano reductions (with the same VST configuration as before) tied together with possible audio recordings, into a new project page, and there I can now edit the notation, splice parts together, transfer voices into separate tracks/staffs, and develop the parts through more traditional composition methods. I don't need great engraving capabilities, but compositional tools like transposition and retrograde, and some common ornaments would be great. The goal is not a perfect mock-up or a publishable engraving, but a finished composition.

That's the heart of what I've been doing in the last few years, mostly between Studio One and Notion and pen & paper. But it always remained a cumbersome operation that surely could be much easier. Apparently, the newest Studio One has its own score editor now, which might make the procedure more straightforward. But maybe there's something else entirely out there that would be perfect for my process? Does anybody here have an idea?

Thank you kindly!

**TL/DR:** Need software where I can jam freely, turn the jams into a piano reduction quickly, and then work with those piano reductions conveniently.

zmsz1y,Practicing Orchestration Analysis,"Hello!  


I have always learned to compose music by interpreting what my favorite composers do. Since I enjoy more film and video game music than anything else, it is often the case that my favorite pieces do not have scores available to study. This leaves me to listen to the composition and use my own ear to isolate each part of the orchestra and determine what's happening in the music.  


I'd say I do a decent job of analyzing music in this way, but not as effectively as I'd like. I can understand the harmony pretty well. With orchestration, I can figure out where the melody is being played and often know which instruments are doubling it. 

I can hear accompaniment elements, but this is where I have to start inferring  harmony from the bass notes as it becomes difficult for me to pick out exactly what the accompaniment is doing or what is playing it. I might be able to hear some brass chords, but I might not be able to tell if it's just French Horns, Trombones, or both together - I might be able to tell what the top note of the chord is being played by the brass, but I must infer what the inner notes of the chord are by listening to the bass. I might be able to hear a rhythmic string pattern, but not be able to tell if it's the second violins or violas playing it, or if perhaps the clarinets are helping them.  


Are there any good techniques to get better at clearly hearing what every part of the orchestra is playing? I know this often depends on the quality of the orchestration, but this is a general issue I seem to have.",1671130692.0,Jacobmb_Music

And even though I truly respect and appreciate the people I work with, it's just not sustainable and it's driving me kinda crazy, especially now that I've achieved a tangible taste of my dream. I don't have nearly enough time to practice my instruments or have a semblance of balance in my life due to effectively working 7 days a week.

I know it might have to be like this for a short amount of time, but I'd like to transition to full time music as soon as possible, so that leads me to the question:

Is it unprofessional to ask the devs/artists on our team if they know of any other projects looking for audio peeps? It's a very small team (>10 people), we all get along super well, and they genuinely love what I've done so far and give really great feedback (especially when a draft for something doesn't QUITE fit) but I don't want to overstep the boundaries of our relatively short relationship. I feel this is the foundation for my career, and the start of something really cool with my team, but I wanted to get some sound advice from other composers before goin' straight to asking.

Thanks for everything y'all! This community has been immensely helpful already, and I can't thank you enough.",1671052864.0,mistaquik
zm0s8d,Title suggestions for a movement in Sonata-Allegro Form,"In a multi-movement work, you can name an individual movement ""Scherzo"", ""Minuet"", ""Sarabande"", ""Chaconne"", ""Rondo"" etc to emphasize that this movement has a particular kind of form. If the overall work is titled ""Sonata"", ""Concerto"" etc the first movement ""Allegro"" tends to be in sonata-allegro form. 

Consider a very non-traditional piece structure. Suppose you're writing a multi-movement piece named not after a form. (Suppose you name your piece something like ""Exotic Birds"" or something like that). And you want to title a movement (doesn't have to be the first one) such that its sonata-allegro form is emphasized. What would you title this movement then? It could be ""Sonata"" but that feels way too non-idiomatic because sonatas are multi-movement pieces, it feels confusing. Could be ""Allegro"" but that doesn't seem obvious enough (because the title ""Allegro"" could also only be referring to the tempo), besides you may be writing in slow or very slow tempo. E.g. you may have a very slow 3rd movement that is in sonata-allegro form, and you may want to title it something like ""Sonata"".

Any ideas?",1671048389.0,BrokenWineGlass

This time it's a new festive work for SATB choir, piano, and oboe.

zlqp52,"Wind quintet, first draft for feedback","I'm going to park this until January so seems as good a time as any to get some feedback, if anyone wants to give it a listen.

It started with the idea of 'chromatic chorale', and each movement has a varying balance of those two things. The melodic material and most of the harmony are based on a melody that I think only appears fully formed in the dirge at the end, but there should be threads of it running throughout.

The first movement is intentionally more vanilla than the others, but I don't know whether that means it's not as interesting or needs a bit more to keep people's attention over the 4-5 minutes. Section C still needs some work as I can't find the right balance of playfulness without falling too far into jazz.

The second movement needs some more work overall and the third is mainly sketches of ideas at this point.

Happy for any feedback. :)

I love working on music, ^(as a) ^(Client.)  


My inspirations and general trends go quite far, I'm not super fond of digitally produced music, but I know it must be done! Ain't noway I have the funds for live design... Someday in my future, I hope so.  


In other words, the tracks will be pretty extensive. J-Rock, J-Pop, Fast Jazz, Unusual Instrument Mixtures (Banjo instead of Electric Guitar for some Tracks), Choir Tracks (Halo 1 Intro)  
The most important ones, however, are Ballads & Modernised Music Box melodies. (I love Music Box sounds but the rustic way the original machine works is oof, but new digital era has potential!)  


I'd love to go on about this forever, but my music tastes are stupidly pronounced.

So, not a long time ago I sent my soundcloud profile to SIIX because I wanted to work for them. Trailer music isn't something I see myself doing for the rest of my life, but I honestly think it's fun.  
So the company's music director Lorenzo emails me back, says a few nice things, but ends the email with a ""please research more before reaching out again"", which I found kinda aggressive, but I thought, ""ok, I guess he's probably that way with anyone. No problem. I'm gonna learn and get in touch again."" So I thank him and go work on my stuff.  


So I sent them more music a few weeks ago and get no answer for a while until they respond with, ""you're music is not there yet, but we're now offering consulting for those who want to learn trailer music.""  
Now, that wouldn't have been a problem for me if they had listened to the tracks and genuinely thought they sucked... The problem is they never did.  
I have Souncloud Pro and obviously you can see where people who listen to your stuff are from.  
No one from Los Angeles or even the USA (I'm from France) even accessed my profile or listened to the tracks. And do you wanna know something else? Not even the first time I reached out to them!  
Yes, the first time when the guy told me to ""research more"" no one from SIIX listened to anything as well.

WTF?  
So why be assholes to me, tell me to learn, criticize my music without listening to it? Just to sell me consulting services?

The goal of this piece is to end with a Grade 4/5 piece in 6/8 and 7/8 time (coming towards the last half).

Thankfully, I didn't go through with it and I've picked myself up day by day, week by week and I've been doing much better. The only problem is that now, for the sake of my writing, I need to get back to that ""hopeless"" and ""no light at the end of the tunnel"" mindset so I can write truthfully for this second half of the movement. Has anyone else ever had this problem? That they needed to be in a mindset to capture the emotion but they can't get themselves back there?

My specific question is if bars 6 to the beginning of 8 are correct.

The progression, in A minor, is moving from E minor 1st inversion down at the beginning of m6 down to a french sixth (dominant 7 flat five in jazz-speak) with an f in the bass. This french sixth harmony is, in my mind, maintained from bar 6.5 through to bar 7, finally resolving at the beginning of bar 8.

Other notes in this range are non-harmonic.

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 729 people have responded with over _one thousand_ unique composers in their rankings! Given this fact, it is likely you will add a composer to the roster of those already mentioned. If you have a composer you feel deserves more recognition, this is the place to put them for all to see! You never know if you may be the first to mention them.

To clarify for those who haven’t come across this poll, this is _not_ to rank which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : the instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) 

There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect several more reminders throughout this last month as the poll begins to close down and responses recorded. Poll Ends December 31st

zilyft,If You Can't Replicate Your Instruments Should You Still Compose?,"Let me start off by saying I have composed zero pieces, and I'm an extreme novice when it comes to music. I've dabbled in Fruity Loops with free vsts and I have a Yamaha keyboard but I don't know how to play it except through muscle memory. That said, I have songs in my head. I know what instruments are used, but I don't know what notes are playing. Meaning, I can hear the notes, but it would take time for me to find them on a keyboard as I have no idea what note I am hearing off the bat notation wise. 

Example, I hear trumpets. I hear the notes and how long they hold their notes for, but I don't know if it is a B or a C etc... Until I hit the key. Eventually I learn the muscle memory to use these keys. My biggest issue tho, is that I can't replicate certain techniques using software that I know a real person would be able to.

Example. A violin does three of the same notes quickly as it flows into other notes. Or, a violin slides from one note to another. The free software i have can't do this. (As far as I'm aware, at least). 

Eventually though, I memorize the keys for a section, like the solo violin as the strings in the background are playing, but then comes my biggest issue... The sound. The Instruments I have sound NOTHING like the ones in my head. Sure sometimes I'll get a few that are amazing, but then others I'll get some that can't replicate the sounds I am after. So then I feel like the piece, if I WAS to make it, would sound terrible UNLESS I had those instruments. 

With all these factors: the sound of the instruments, the technique of the instruments, and not knowing what notes my instruments are played in off the top of my head (I can hum the notes but again, no clue what they are notation wise) should I just NOT compose until I actually have the instruments I need? Or should I just use crappy instruments for a first draft, and then later IF I get a way to use different instruments, just remake it with said instruments? 

I'm on the fence because I feel like if I make something, it has to be a quality I can stand behind, and if it isn't up to my standards, then I'm doing a disservice. But again, I just want to know if that's a negative way to think about things. Thanks for your time and hope you have an awesome day =)",1670750649.0,Towhater

zhh1sf,Genuinely curious: how do people without perfect pitch decide what keys to write their stuff in?,"I hate mentioning perfect pitch because people always see it as a flex but I’m seriously curious about this. For me I feel like I associate different feelings or moods with different keys, so I’m wondering how people who might not have this association make decisions about key. For example, if I want something to feel “dark” (in either major or minor) I might use A-flat/G-sharp since I feel like that’s the darkest key, whereas if I want something to feel light I’d probably tend towards with a key with fewer accidentals.

I think for me I often (but not always) use whatever key I came up with the thing in, but I think I actually write differently in different keys so I think that might not be the same. In general if I followed this all the time I think I would be worried about stuff like using white-key keys too often, or only writing pentatonically with black keys, for example.",1670641210.0,ahedgehog
zheltb,Courses to fill the gap from piano composition to video-games and film music,"Hello, I have previously taken harmony and composition course., which I applied to composing my own music, mainly for piano. I managed to become quite confident in this very specific task, but whenever I try to write music using other instruments, i.e. acoustic or synths, I feel intimidated by the process, as:

1-I just randomly add instruments, hoping that they will sound find all together.

2-Notes from the piano often do not directly translate into i.e. a bassline, or xylophone, or a synthetic arpeggiator.

3-I feel I am quite limited in using a sequencer (in my case logic X), and this may affect my workflow and my focus on the actual music writing.

Given the priority to number 1 and 2, do you know any good practical courses (youtube, coursera, university, books etc) which I can use to fill this gap? Not necessarily free.

Hi,

I will have a new release coming out soon and am looking to get some reviews to help generate buzz in a targeted community. Can anyone suggest review sites that might be interested in an unknown composer?

This release is entirely instrumental and intended for indie film makers, trailer houses, game dev's and others who are interested in instrumental, highly atmospheric music but with a definite pulse.

21 tracks - most of them around 2:30 minutes duration, some around 4:30. Influences include Death Beats(genre), Doom (M. Gordon's OST), Halflife, Cyberpunk 2077, Future Sound of London, the overall impression of films like Blade Runner & Blade Runner 2049 and maybe director Terry Gilliam ala Brazil.

Futuristic but with distorted/disturbed contemporary elements.

Sounds/instrumentation includes synths, altered acoustic instruments, heavily manipulated noise/found sound, pitched and percussive orchestral, pianos and some altered voice.

Regardless of the software, proofreading is important. Assuming that you're satisfied with the text as the program understands it and all your voices and instruments are in their proper ranges, these are some things that I think need to be checked before trying to publish a score:

* The names of voices and instruments are spelled correctly and specified clearly.
* Every entering voice or instrument has a dynamics marking (including one of a pair of instruments on the same staff)
* Notes that can be close together aren't too close together
* Accidentals don't clash with notes, articulations or other score elements
* Courtesy accidentals are provided for all next measure cancellations (so the musician isn't left wondering if the composer forgot to specify)
* Rehearsal letters or other kinds of signposts for rehearsal are plentifully provided
* Staves are spaced farther apart in the more congested passages
* Top staff doesn't crash with the page header, bottom staff doesn't crash with the page footer

zf8ase,"Thoughts on sharing audio file with musicians, and letting them play one layer at a time","For context, I just finished a string quartet and trying get it played by a professional artist. However, when I contacted artists online, I was often asked to provide an audio sample from the notation software.

I had mixed feelings about this. On one hand it's trivial as I already have this audio file. However, I'm inclined not to share it because I want the input to the artist to be just the sheet music. I'm most interested in seeing the notation creating music. Moreover, I do not want the artist to be influenced by the terrible computer render. I use MuseScore and I absolutely *love* it, but it doesn't create realistic audio like NotePerformer etc so it sounds extremely robotic and awkward. There are some very emotional parts in this string quartet, and I want the artist to interpret them themselves, as indicated by the notation.

When I asked artists why they're asking for audio, some of them said this is for synchronization. They said that they'll record one instrument at a time and then merge them. I was surprised by this. My string quartet has very fast, challenging and rubato parts, how can they realistically do this without coordinating with cues? Are these essentially ""soft"" scams, in the sense that they're truly good professional artists but they go into this job knowing it's not going to be as good as 4 musicians playing together? This convinces me even more not to share the audio file as I don't want to help people doing this.

Thoughts on this? Am I overreacting? This work means *so much* to me, I spent the entire 2022 working on it. I don't want to cheap out; I want to find a good artist who can do this well. Any thought is welcome.",1670435936.0,BrokenWineGlass

My goal is to get a piece for every technique so all sounds can be represented.  Every day I'm adding a little more.

I also got some super niche instruments that I think the community would enjoy.  Yesterday I recorded the Lujon (used by George Crumb), Bar Chimes, and Bell Plates.  They are all relatively ""simple"" instruments in terms of construction, but there are insanely cool spectralist-esque techniques you can use with the overtone series and acoustic setting manipulation.

I'm still open to some of you composers helping out on the project, so if you have new music and would like it posted in the anthology, send me a DM or leave a comment!  Your work will be alongside faculty from Stanford, Berklee, UCSD, and many others to come :)

>While the key change was once a mark of musical sophistication, many now  consider it a crutch. Dalla Riva says a lot of his peers think using  the key change is lazy.

but then goes on to describe the key where you jump up a half-step or a whole-step. I do not think that key changes are crutch if they are well crafted. As usual, these type of articles are speaking out key changes as used in pop music and through out a blanket statement like, ""using the key change is lazy.""

I think there is some truth in what they are saying, that now artist are focusing on using rhythm and texture over the notes and chord progressions. But I believe this is actually a result of lack of music education. IMO, they are doing this, not because they want to be original, but it's what sells. Rhythm and texture is the easiest for the untrained listeners to understand. The average listener wouldn't appreciate an interesting chord progression or melody were to hit them on the nose.

The sounds are actually pretty good, no idea how well it responds to articulations etc because I've never really listened to it that way, and vibrato is a bit ropey, but it's usually pretty listenable, far better than any native MIDI file playback I've heard on a computer, and can give you a different perspective on your writing if not necessarily ever going to make a polished final product.

Quick aside: I am a first-year music student in college, and most of my musical knowledge is from years of picking up tricks from random internet blogs and YouTube videos. Please forgive me if I have made any notation errors in the score.

&#x200B;

Like always, things started off really well. About a week ago, I had a spark of inspiration after class and just started writing stuff down. The idea didn't come from a laborious session of thinking out what the whole piece would look like. I just sort of heard my brain fire off what I can only describe as a completed cross-section of a larger piece, and I quickly wrote it down before it escaped me. That initial idea was the first four bars in the PDF. 

The chords and the flute melody came from similar inspirations, just following what sounded good in my head. I was in a flow state for this part, so if there was any consideration for music theory at this stage either I don't remember it or it was completely subconscious. I did sit down at a piano at one point to figure out the voicing for the marimba arpeggio over the new chords. 

However, it was at this point that I started to bump into an issue that I know all too well. I tried to avoid it, instead spending time writing an oboe harmony to extend the piece just a little bit further, but alas, it was only a matter of time before I had to face an enemy that has followed me since the beginning: the B section.

My weakness as a composer is that after I've gushed out the first 30 to 60 seconds of a piece in a fit of passion, I have absolutely no clue where to go from there. I'll spend days writing tons of melodies and chord progressions that sound good on their own, but when it comes time to slot them in after the initial idea the result invariably feels jarring and unnatural. 

This has plagued me for the entire time I've been writing music, especially when it comes to chord progressions. I'm completely torn on why this is, not to mention what the hell I'm supposed to do about it. One of my professors told me that my harmonic language will develop as I progress through the music theory course, another told me that I need to expand my repertoire for my declared instrument to get a ""broader musical perspective"", and another told me to just listen to music similar to what you're writing (which isn't helpful when I don't know the first thing about distinguishing different styles).

zbkgy5,"Not being able to finish music, stops me from sitting down to write in the first place...","Hi All,

I have now made music for about 2-3 years, I have written pieces I am proud of, I have also written some that I did not share with the world, but I always try to make a conscious effort to not let perfectionism get in the way of sharing my music with the world and tell myself ""It's good enough, just release it!"".

Now, I have unfortunately noticed that I find it very hard to sit down and actually start writing some new music regularly... I have managed to find the culprit of this and narrowed it down to a simple but important factor in the process; and that is to come up with an idea and them turn it into a full piece of music that is more than just 1 minute long.

I write orchestral and hybrid video game music, and I keep hearing my favourite composers spit out 4-5 minutes of music like it's nothing - A part of me wants to be able to do this, but I sometimes find it extremely hard to get past the 2 minute mark, due to not knowing where to take the music and its different sections, I have noticed this is actively stopping me from sitting down in my free time to make more music, because I know that I will eventually get stuck mid writing a new piece, and not know what the next section should be in the cue, and eventually just close my DAW in frustration and call it a day...

I come up with a nice idea and manage to develop it, and on a good day everything just flows and it's great, but on most days I get to 1 minute of music and I feel like *""Okay, so I guess this is where the song ends, because I have no idea what should come next...""*. It is very frustrating and takes away the enjoyment of wanting to write in the first place... I also have a slight desire to some day try to do music professionally, but I keep questioning whether I eventually will have the patience and workflow to get things delivered on a deadline...

&#x200B;

For proper context, I want to include some facts about my music and my workflow, that hopefully provides a bit of a better understanding of how I make music:

\- *As mentioned above, I write video game music; mostly in the fantasy and sci-fi genre (Big percussion, epic horns and strings, choirs, as well as quiet and atmospheric ambient pieces)*

*- I am greatly inspired by the music in video games such as the* ***Elder Scrolls*** *franchise,* ***World of Warcraft*** *and other titles that fit role playing action and adventure.*

*- I come up with an idea and use it as a motif/foundation and try to develop a whole piece out of it, it can some times be a melody or rhythmic pattern on strings, it works but at some point I get stuck, after 2-3 sections...*

*- My DAW of choice is Logic Pro, and I use Audio Imperia's* ***Nucleus*** *and* ***Chorus*** *for orchestral sample libraries.*

*- Often I listen to music in a very analytical manner, I really pay attention to what is happening and take mental notice of how it's structured. But even after being able to understand the music very well and how it was composed, I still struggle to put it into practice in my own compositions...*

*- I have tried to watch lots of videos on music composition and how to turn an idea into a finished piece of music, but I don't really seem to be able take that information/tips and actually use it...*

*- I have noticed that if I write something that I really like myself, I probably end up listening to it over and over again, instead of getting on with finishing the whole song. I have heard that this can have a very bad impact on your creativity?*

&#x200B;

Do you guys have some wisdom when it comes to this kind of problem, or any ideas how to overcome this frustration of mine that is keeping me from doing something that I love doing, but without it being tiresome?

I know I am ""cut out"" to make music, as I have been a musician for most of my life and I love it so much. So this is not a question of talent, but probably lack of exposure/practice perhaps?

za7c6d,Who Are The Great Lyricists of the Twentieth Century?," have a hypothesis based on opinion (which means it's not a hypothesis) that the great songs of the Great Rock Songbook (my term ) are more lyric driven in their construction than songs from The Great American Songbook. Like him or not, Dylan is among the most influential songwriters ever. His lyrics earned him a Nobel prize for literature. That is not nothing. Obviously, what stands out about his songs are his lyrics that lend themselves to interpretations by other musicians. The covers take on whole new melodic shapes from the originals.( I still don't know how many roads a man must walk down. Is it seven?)
So who else of this era is among your favorite lyricists?
As far as TGAS, the ethos was much different. Most of the great songwriters had separate lyricists. My personal favorite is Cole Porter, who wrote both great melodies and great lyrics. He had a knack for being risque’ without crossing the line of the standards of the era. I also love the way he would force rhymes. (If you can’t be a ham and do Hamlet, they won’t give a damn or a damlet.) The premise of this song is great: learning Shakespeare will get you laid.
Of course, we must exclude the rap/hip-hop era because often lyrics have a much priority over melody and harmony. So please share your favorites and why.",1669945481.0,Wintersbone7

So a while back I posted on here wondering which composers have been inspired by Grieg, but now I have the opposite question.

I am wondering if someone could give me some clear info on if they know any classical composers that have inspired grieg in some of his work. After doing some online googling I've heard vague and different opinions like people saying Grieg hasn't been inspired by anyhow, and people saying f.e. Debussy inspired Grieg greatly.

And even if people said a certain composer has inspired grieg, they often don't come with examples of the similarities.

So my question is, are there any pieces by Grieg in which you can see he clearly was inspired to some extend by another composer (and in which piece of said composer can I clearly hear similarities, and/or with explanation a music-theory similarity which isn't necessarily heard but does exist if you look at f.e. chord progressions).

z8w62f,7800 votes submitted - One Month Remaining on the Large Scale Google Poll — Who are you Favorite Composers? — 100 Day Update,"One Hundred days in! Yes I know there have been two reminders this month. But I am very excited to announce that there are more than 7800 votes on the [Large Scale Google Composer Poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxXI2Ag4ai2bm1ATguas2WdDCag2MZesGONVT4O8ttqBqiHg/viewform) now. The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 675 people have responded with over _nine hundred_ unique composers in their rankings! Given this fact, it is likely you will add a composer to the roster of nearly a thousand already mentioned. If you have a composer you feel deserves more recognition, this is the place to put them for all to see! You never know if you may be the first to mention them.

To clarify for those who haven’t come across this poll, this is _not_ to rank which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : the instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) 

There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect several more reminders throughout this last month as the poll begins to close down and responses recorded. Poll Ends December 31st

Also, I usually turn the volume off when I'm using the computer (the MIDI sounds are a bit distracting), so it really helps me develop my inner ear to try to make sense of the randomness. So yeah, it's really interesting how the abilities/limitations of a certain interface can affect your writing.

z86vc6,The Legend of Zelda Music Encyclopedia: an analysis of the theory and influences behind it,"The music of the Zelda series is some of the most memorable and influential in video games. And in some of the games it even has a prominent role, being incorporated into the gameplay and as part of a cohesive narrative.

This is the reason why i wanted to see how it is made and the cultural and game design influences that go into it. This is why I was happy to learn that the actual music from the games made during the Nintendo 64 era (and even beyond!) lives inside the games' ROM files and code. After playing around a with some tools, I managed to get the original music files used. Everything is there, from the instruments used to the instructions on how they should be played, and the note sequences. Now we can get almost perfect reproductions of the music as standard music files. Thus, i decided to do a throughout analysis of the music and get as in-depth as possible into how it is made and what went into the compositions and sound design.

For the moment, i just finished the analysis of the two games of the Nintendo 64 era; with the resources, it was easy to make music visualization videos where you can see the exact notes played and all the instrument that go into each of the tracks. you can also check out additional media that helps to point out some aspects of the music. Here is a full playlist with each entry and the analysis; my wish is also to get more contributions and comments about each piece in order to get a complete understanding of the music, along with your thoughts on the tracks: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVv3ELJlNuw&list=PLETz1iOEUzpfCNJZNECrGiCR-2HJKXy_p)

I hope this will be great to gain more appreciation for the music and a valuable resource for musicians and audio enthusiasts. An extensive investigation went into the music and I’m sure you will find lots of interesting info, specially of you are interested in media composition and how, with limited resources, the composers of the era managed to create the music in older system.

I also want to continue with the project and perhaps start incorporating different games and consoles in order to create video game music encyclopedia that can become a good reference for music enthusiasts. so if you have other soundtracks where you would like a similar treatment please let me know.

The original intention was to do the project in an even more interactive way, something where you can click on the particular set of instruments you want to hear at a time, but I have not found anything out there that can do that. If any of you know some way to do it I would be glad to know. Something like this: [https://streamable.com/x73wbt](https://streamable.com/x73wbt)

In any case, a lot of care was put into the making of these games and it shows in the music. so i hope you find it interesting. Please tell me what you think and you can ask me any questions about the soundtracks or how video game music was made, I am going to try to dig a little more info.

I've been a musician (rock guitar, classical guitar, some cello, some bass, some lute) for a good while and have a decent understanding of music theory (good with voice leading, understanding chords/keys, etc). My musical tastes are really eclectic, everything from Early Music to Folk to Contemporary 'Classical' and a ton of things in between.  


But what I'd like to be doing is actual composition, either in traditional 'Classical' pieces, or possibly some scorewriting. When it gets to that point, I always run into some trouble. My compositions tend to end up mainly root position Major/Minor with predictable cadences, and any attempt I make to expand beyond that becomes either bland sounding, or painfully dissonant, and not in a fun serialist way.  


Does anyone have a good composition course that they'd recommend? Something that will at least give a few starting points on how to make my music more interesting to hear? I'm okay with having to work out any points of theory that I'm not great with, but the 'beginner learn to compose' classes seem to be a money-grab, and aimed at a more basic level than I'm currently at in regards to theory etc. If anyone has suggestions (youtube, paid courses, whatever), I'd be really grateful.",1669734569.0,notableradish

z5juvm,How much do you structure your works before beginning to write them?,"These days I don't have the luxury to write things only when inspiration hits, so oftentimes when I need to write something the very first thing I do is structure pretty much the entire work. I decide the form, phrases, key(s), etc., all before I've really even decided a melody or progression. Then I take my structure and fill it out from there.

It's a method that generally makes the creative process somewhat easier, especially helpful when I'm under time pressure to write something, but more recently I've been finding it also extremely limiting in a way; with so much decided before the music has really started to be written, I think it might be limiting my creative output by locking me in a box, so to speak.

z3h84u,"How to score ""messy"" glissando","We've all heard this effect in loads of different places, but how would one go about scoring it using traditional notation for a string section? The idea is that each individual instrument (not just in sections) plays a version of gliss that are all different, so as to achieve an atonal ""mess"" of rising pitch.  


The only ways I can imagine scoring glissandi would result in the orchesta playing very tonally, with a clear beginning and end note, and that's what the effect seems to completely avoid.  


So I guess it boils down to: Is there an accepted method of scoring ""everyone play this (gliss but with the same general idea) independently of each other""?   


This example is still a bit too ""musical"" in that it ends with everyone in the same place tonally, but it's the best link I could find in a hurry: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7BHEcXNduU&ab\_channel=SoundsRecorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7BHEcXNduU&ab_channel=SoundsRecorded)",1669288096.0,shinymcshine1990

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 575 people have responded with over _nine hundred_ unique composers in their rankings. The average voter submits a list about 12 composers long. 

I am wanting 1000 participants by New Years 2023 (or whichever comes first.) I am over _halfway_ there thanks to all of you! Trends are no doubt starting to appear as more responses come in.

To clarify, this is _not_ a poll for ranking which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : The instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work, you’d be surprised.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! (Except in the case of misspellings, do double check your submissions.) 

There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it. Expect several more reminders throughout this last month as well as a reminder in ten days for the 100 day update with a chart of the interactions with the poll thus far.

So the title is ""conflict"" but these are two folk who like each other, they're just having a disagreement about buying expensive and breakable things. 

I'm specifically trying for a '30s-'40s feel, like a buddy song. This is a long form, more or less AA'BCAA'', and for the full scene will probably be repeated in full twice (getting more varied and complex as it goes). This is a first cut at material that would be expanded on, sliced and diced with spoken word and elaborated more once I get the lyrics from my lyricist and we work out the exact plot of the scene. 

Know the RH needs some arranging, just plain half notes for max clarity in hearing the harmony for now. 

I'm not quite sold on the chords in 18-21. 

Any thoughts on being idiomatic, handling the duets, etc much appreciated.

z0exlf,Question about creating cues in parts for individual instruments,"Hi all, I’m brand new to this sub, and the first thing I’m doing is posting something. I just finished a wind septet, and I’m working on the parts right now. I’ve had trouble finding information about how frequently to use cues, what degree of detail they should have, and how they should be expressed. I’m using Notion6 software, which allows for smaller notes to indicate cues. 

In general, I’m placing cues after either a large multi-measure rest area, or if the meter is tricky enough to obscure the count leading to the next entry of a particular instrument. As far as the cues themselves, I’m generally choosing whatever instrument seems to be prominent right before entry, as in if the clarinet is prominent I place a few notes of the clarinet line before the bassoon enters. I feel like I may be in overkill area, though, placing them where there’s even a small chance of one losing their place. Also, I’m not sure if I should indicate register or even identify the instrument. Specifically, if it’s clear that a clarinet is proceeding a bassoon entry, do I need to indicate that it’s clarinet, and do I need to indicate it’s register (with an 8va or 15ma, etc., whichever the case may be.) The difficulty level of the work is advanced intermediate/advanced. For that reason, it may be that someone who can play it is good enough that they wouldn’t need the large number of cues I’m placing in.

The music composition minor was a late addition to my degree, but I've fallen absolutely in love with it; if I could go back in time to when I was a freshman, I might have become a composition major instead. While I'm thankful for all of the learning opportunities I've had in college, I've realized that my university has failed to set me up for the real world in a handful of ways, one of them being music production. 

As I mentioned above, I'm also a psychology major. At the moment, I'm planning on pursuing my PhD in that field to become a researcher. I'm still incredibly passionate about music, though, and it's been a really hard for me to decide which career path to follow a PhD in. So, I'm hoping that I can find some ways to learn to produce music while still being in school for my PhD. I'm really interested in learning how to produce music so I can producer my own stuff (I'm a vocalist and multi instrumentalist), and also so I could potentially have a future in producing songs for others or selling songs I've written. Does anyone have recommendations of online courses to take, or other things I should try to seek out related to producing? I'm pretty in the dark on the whole production process, and my school doesn't really have any production resources for me to mess around with, so any advice is deeply appreciated!",1668976685.0,lemurificspeckle

My name is Epik.
So for the past 2 months, I’ve been working on an animated movie.

The whole movie isn’t going to be orchestrated, with some 8-bit and Jazz Fusion, but I want this movie to convey emotion and sincerity, while still being light-hearted.
If there are any questions, let me know.

yymekk,Advice For The Lesser Trained Of Us...,"For those of us who have been doing this for a while, this will not be a surprise, but for those that are new to this, this advice (I think) is very helpful (particularly because I didn't get taught this, but rather, my ego instinctively made me do this). On Monday, I went to a recital hosted by a university near my residence, in which the performer was a world-renowned double bassist. There was a ""meet the performer, in the flesh!!!"" thing at the end of the recital, and when I got to him, I had with me my laptop and a collection of pieces for solo double bass I had written about a year and a half ago, hoping that I could just show him a little bit of my work. By the end of that interaction, he ended up asking me for that collection of pieces (which is probably the composition highlight of the last six months - it'd be for the year if it were not for me finishing my first symphony in April), saying ""I'm always looking for new repertoire,"" and he invited me to email him more of my bass works. 

So, what's the advice? 

When you attend recitals, especially for instruments that not every five-year-old knows about, and chamber ensembles, take physical copies of your music for said instrument or ensembles with you. Even if you don't get to talk directly to the performer (particularly for solo recitals), those recitals tend to be big reunions for people that play that particular instrument, which means a large number of people you can get to at least look at the music you wrote, and they think about you when they need to commission work.

The piece is in scherzo-trio form, with two distinct theme groups and keys in the scherzo, making it almost akin to a sonata, except the development has been replaced with the trio.

Surely more classicistic than classical because of my usual eclectic elements. Otherwise not much to say about this. Just a bit of absolute music in a relatively simple ABACABA form, with the last A being a big loud coda where a simple motif brags about how epic it can sound, so don't miss this part. And of course pedal notation is cum grano salis, before anyone comes complaining.

I hope this is playable, but as long as I can play something in half the tempo I assume an actual pianist can play it properly. Well, my computer didn't complain at least.

ywwaly,"MuseScore 4 beta, MuseSounds, and a string quartet demonstration","Has anyone else checked out the recent betas of MuseScore 4? The VST integration makes it a huge leap over MuseScore 3, plus a few nice engraving tweaks and a lot of quality of life improvements (eg inserting 'pizz', 'arco', 'sul pont', etc, automatically switches the instrument without having to do anything manually; rit and accel actually do something so you don't need to insert four non-printing tempo changes every bar). Muse Group (the for-profit company that owns [musescore.com](https://musescore.com), not to be confused with [musescore.org](https://musescore.org)) also released beta versions of 'MuseSounds', a bunch of virtual instrument packs that are a huge improvement over the nasty old default MuseScore soundfonts.

Oh, did I mention they're free? It's still early days but they are approaching the quality of professional virtual instruments. So far I've been playing around with the solo strings and they are extremely nice for free software. It's only a beta version, but it includes things you'd expect in an expensive product like high quality round-robin samples, separate samples for different dynamics, legato transitions, col legno, sul tasto, sul pont, and harmonics.

There are a few quirks with it. The dynamics need some ironing out. For instance you can write ff and it will usually play ff, but if there's a pp coming up it will automatically introduce a diminuendo. Which is very annoying - if I wanted a dim I'd write a dim. There is some weirdness going on with the way it ""intelligently"" decides whether to treat a legato or slurred interval as needing a portamento effect. Which can sound quite beautiful and naturalistic in some contexts, but completely out of place in others, and there isn't any way to manually turn it on or off. But again, this is a beta of MuseScore 4 and an \*early\* beta of MuseSounds and there is a pretty large community of people working on it. For free.

Anyway, this is all pretty amazing and the people at Dorico and Noteperformer should be a bit nervous about the whole thing. The software itself seems pretty stable - I have only had one crash and I've been using it a couple of hours a day for a few weeks. And it's not like MuseScore 3.6 never crashes.

ywgo7d,Adjusting CC velocity levels for dynamics in Finale,"I am helping a friend create decent quality mp3s of his score that he created in Finale by importing his MIDI files into Logic and using my BBCSO Pro instruments to play it. The first hurdle we encountered was that the dynamics wrote the CC information to MIDI volume. I figured out how to have that CC information export to modulation instead, which is the CC that BBCSO uses for dynamics. The problem now is that Finale's dynamics markings have set velocity parameters (some number between 0 and 127 to dictate p, mp, mf, f, as well as crescendos, accents, etc) that are a little different than BBCSO's. Perhaps Finale is leaving room for ppp, and maybe that's 0-10. But for BBCSO, that's an adequate p. Finale's p might be 30-50, but for BBCSO that sounds like mp. And mp sounds like mf, etc etc, you get the idea.

Does anyone know how to set dynamics in Finale to output certain midi CC numbers? Say, set p to be 10, and f to be 90, or something like this?

This has come with some experimentation and I've reached a point where I've written something I'm proud of and want show other people.

Feedback is of course very much appreciated, though I do consider this song finished and will most likely not be making any changes to it. I'd love to know what I could do better in the future though!

Thanks!

yw5bic,EW Hollywood Orchestra - Trouble playing chords,"So I just got EastWest HollyWood Orchestra Opus edition, and I'm trying to figure out how to use this stuff. Earlier on I have used the free Spitfire BBC orchestra and Reason with Orkester sounds. I was really looking forward to setting up Hollywood Orchestra after a literal day of downloading, but I'm having some issues.

Whenever I try to play chords, all the notes never seem to start at the same time. Even if I edit in a midi chord with all the notes starting at the exact same time, it sounds like the instruments are just slightly out of time, which again sounds pretty horrible. I have turned off ""mono true legato"", so I'm not playing in mono either, all the notes are ringing, but they are just not starting at the same time. If I set a really long attack time, this obscures the flaw, but that's not a solution I'm willing to live with.

yu7tbr,Yellow Rose (Live at Rocky Mountain National Park),"Hi, everyone. I'm Kamen. Last year I wrote a really ambitious piano solo album called ""I Dreamt We Fell in Love"". The music is pretty wild because unlike other composing and songwriting projects I've embarked on, I didn't impose any limits or parameters on myself when writing these pieces and I'm really proud of how they turned out.

I called the very first piece I wrote for the album ""Yellow Rose"", and there's a nice story behind it which I've written in the description of the live video I've included via link below. I enlisted my incredibly fierce drummer friend, Ben DeUrso to play this piece with me as a duo for a live performance we got to do at Rocky Mountain National Park this Autumn, and we've just released the video and audio everywhere we could think of a few days ago (streaming, etc.).

I'm not terrific at marketing because I pour so much energy into composing and crafting, and I think a lot of the people here that might read this will probably relate. I would really appreciate some views and listens and comments and I'd love to see more of your stuff on here too!

I have transcribed the piano music into formal sheet music, and I'm hoping Ben will notate their drum parts as well one day in the future. I of course welcome any analytical discourse of the material itself from a theoretical vantage point since I'm a sniveling music freak who loves talking about nothing else more.

I thought it would be fun to make videos of composition livestreams and I finally had the time to edit *part of* a livestream where I wrote [""Sonata Vanile""](https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/xdlktq/wrote_a_sonataallegro_movement_in_a_conservative/) (posted here two months ago). This sort of thing seems like it could be compelling if done right so I'm testing the waters to see anyone finds it interesting... It took me quite a while to edit this down so depending on the response I'll either keep going or bail entirely :)

This video is longer than I'd like it to be, so my expectations for people watching it are pretty low - **that being said, criticism would be fantastic :)**

This is still an unknown land for me, and I'm wondering about things like:

- Is this an interesting format, or, is there an audience for this?
- How is the recording setup?
- Is the content itself (the piece written, the process) interesting?
- Am I even *talented enough* to do something like this?

And here's the score to the finished piece (edited after the livestream, but basically the same!):

yso2qp,Something I realized way too late...,"I'm going to say something that might offend some, but I feel it is important to do so...and I'm curious to see if anyone has a take. I've been composing music for all of my life (since I was nine years old). I majored in music, studied all of the theory, took composition classes and lessons...the whole nine yards. Instrumentally, I started out as a drum set player, then began learning any instrument I was interested in (Guitar and Piano mostly).

In my composition classes and even in high school, it was always emphasized that if it didn't exist in notation, then it wasn't ""real"" or ""serious"". Band directors would even cut off jam sessions me and the percussionist would take part in throughout middle school and high school.

I've composed many things throughout college and notated everything. Even when I wrote for bands, I would write out all of the parts, even by hand sometimes back when I didn't have a computer. (I'm old) I've written for orchestra, string quartet, and all kinds of percussion ensembles. Some were good lol

Lately though I've been taking different approaches. I realized that most of the musicians I look up to past and present did not rely on notation. Punk bands, rock bands, some jazz bands, electronic musicians all just made music.

I started taking this approach more and started letting the musicians in my band make their own parts.  There would be a written outline sometimes, sometimes lead sheet, and sometimes nothing at all. I found out that my music became freer sounding. I found out that sometimes the notation part of composing was holding back the entire song.  Even when I wrote more personal piano music, I began playing the music itself and coming up with it entirely before notating it...then I would produce it. Finally, I removed the notation step all together...since I don't really see anyone but myself and my band performing my own music.

I came to the conclusion that notating was a means for recording music in its day. If I wanted to give someone a song before recording was accessible, notating all the details of the music on paper was a good start. From there, they can play it for themselves and discover its sound without seeing it performed live. I still think notation is good for that reason.

I realized that I was a bit stubborn in my old ways. I often repeated what was told to me many times. ""If it's not notated, it isn't real music"".  I used to subscribe to that mentality, but now I don't. I listen to more music now than I ever have.

I come here and look at the number one rule of posting music and wonder if notation supreme mentality runs through here. I no longer believe notating and composing are the one in the same.

ysbyam,Question Regarding Composition Schools,"####Hey!

I'm studying composition in Sweden and I'm applying for an exchange student program for a semester next Autumn.

There are a few alternatives, but I'm mainly considering three schools, and I was hoping someone here had experience and/or knowledge of these and could give me some insight!

---

**Cork, Ireland**

I'm mostly considering this one because of the environment and language. I've wanted to live in an English speaking country for quite a while, both because I want to improve my English speaking ability, and also since it feels more comfortable to live in a country where I know the language well. I also find the cheerful traditional folk music of Ireland exciting and inspiring, however I don't typically write in that style.

-

**Bucharest, Romania**

Looking at my interests within music, I feel like this might be the most relevant option. Great modern composers like Ligeti, Xenakis and (in a sense) Bartók all come from Romania, which intrigues me, and I'd like to know how that has impacted the education there. I don't know much about Romania as a country, but I've heard it has a beautiful countryside. 

-

**Ljubljana, Slovenia**

I don't really have any information about Slovenia or the school, but since it's a south eastern/central European country, my guess is that the music has an aesthetic that I'd find interesting. A bonus reason to go here is the location. I'd be a bus ride away from visiting Zagreb - Croatia, Venedig - Italy, and Graz - Austria. Perhaps I wouldn't have time for these trips, but having the option feels exciting!

-

---

**Who am I?**

*Just some brief info about me as a composer.*

I have a hard time defining myself and my music, I take inspiration from here and there. Most prominently I'd say that I write with influences from jazz but in a classical method and format. I also focus *a lot* on rhythm. Odd time signatures and polyrhythms and such are what drive my musical motivation the most. My biggest source of inspiration overall is Armenian jazz pianist Tigran Hamasyan, both his rhythmic complexity as well as the middle-eastern tonality is just so incredible. 

That said, I'm still very curious of essentially all kinds of music and am sure I'll learn a lot where ever I end up.

ys62u4,Symphobia etc to Notation,"Hi All,

I'm not a film composer so have never used something like Symphobia before but it looks like a fun way to sketch/outline ideas, or at least is something I'm tempted to play around with and who doesn't need more playfulness.

Being someone who notates everything though, I think I'd find it frustrating not to have a way to end up with notation without transcribing everything by ear afterwards, which would be much more tedious than just writing the music down to begin with. That said, some of the more 'aleotoric' sounds are quite cool and I'd love to see how they were notated as well.

Which brings me to my question, there doesn't exist something like Symphobia where you can quickly orchestrate ideas, but at the end you can spit out midi for everything being heard? (For import into notation software).

I have a lot more I could say about leading up to composing this piece and the process of it. Instead, I'll leave it out to you, most who I assume are not very familiar with more obscure Balkan music styles, to hear it for yourself- and I would love to hear your feedback and questions. 

On the notation- it most definitely does not contain everything you hear in the piece. I see notation more as a structural tool for organization of a piece rather than a prescription of what to play. 

Improvisation is big, as heard in the ney solo/taksim/mane in the beginning and certain ornamentation techniques that are typical of each instrument, discussed beforehand to form the style. 

&#x200B;

additional info, for anyone interested- 

This piece is the first part of an upcoming series. I've always been intrigued by Macedonian Orthodox chant, hearing it often in my Macedonian household as my father painted icons. During prepping my capstone project while at the ethnomusicology department at UCLA, I worked with many regions and types of Balkan music styles- and eventually I noticed parallel qualities of the first echo (glas) to makam huseyni in the Ottoman (and now Turkish) makam tradition- this is why some may notice similarities in the modality and phrasing. This really interested me, also due to the religious associations of these modal systems and their almost unspoken relationship as they developed in parallel, either in the Orthodox Church chanting or Islamic recitation, or even their imprints on the folk, traditional, and classical musics. Anyways, this piece itself is an original take, and attempt, to bring in these ancient sounds and ideas onto the stage in a slightly new way. The use of the ney makes sense to me because of its old roots interweaving with many traditions over long periods of time. Similar with the ud and kanuns. The clarinet just happens to blend well with this instrumentation and I play it.",1667932673.0,BalkanMusicLA

My instinct is to sell it as one collection, but on a digital service I'm wondering if I'll have better luck selling them individually than asking people to pay me 15-30 bucks for the full collection.

The serenade is currently being rehearesed and will premiere on the 15th of November as a part of a showcase with a few other composers.

yoputm,Sonata Form: How Big is Too Big,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am currently working on my 2nd symphony and had an idea to have the piece in only two movements. The first movement being in sonata form (AB ABC AB), as most first movements are. 

But in this case, I wanted each section of the form (A, B, C) to be comprised of their own sonata form. That means A will be AB AB C AB; B will be AB AB C AB; C will be AB AB C AB

I'll add each of these sections together to create a massive 1st movement. As far as I can read online (with limited searching), this doesn't seem to have been done before.

I have just finished my first A section and am at 13 minutes. If I continue, I'm expecting each section to be the same, totaling around 85 minutes by the end of the first movement. 

Should this be done? Is it practical to be done? Has it been done before?

If there is such a thing as fate, and all your actions can do nothing to prevent pain and suffering that had been set in stone, is there a point in even trying?

Has anyone written a big exciting climax first and then broken it down to provide hints of themes and motifs for the start of the piece? Or come up with something that turned out to be a middle and had variations/transformations of that material bolted onto the front and back of it?

yngeli,The Wagner Dilemna,"This topic  has been  developed from another post about classical vocal music. 

Richard Wagner was one of the most creative and innovative composers of all time. Pure genius. But he was an awful human being. Not just awful. Many great artists have had strange and amoral personal lives. But he was a man who breathed hatred. His antisemetism was burned into not only much of his operas but onto the fabric of German society. He wrote books declaring his bigotry, such as ""Judaism In Music"".  The villians in some of his operas were ancient stereotypes that lacked subtlety. Many people would say to just to seperate the man from his music. But  when one of the greatest  cultural icons of Europe was also one the greatest propagators of hate speech, it's not so easy to just to brush it  aside. Wagner was Hitler's favorite composer and had VIP seats every year at Bayreuth.  He knew Wagner's family very well.  I know of first hand accounts of prisoners forced into death camp orchestras who played Wagner while the victims were herded into the gas chambers.

   But Leonard Bernstein, a man who was passionate about his Judaism, has  several recordings of Wagner's works.

Baremboim knew exactly what he was stirring up. If you have two Jews in a room, you will have three opinions. After a vote, the orchestra chose to perform the works after a 50 year ban on the composer.

ymqxf4,How or how much to abridge longer texts for vocal works,"Real talk. 

I'm a relatively experienced composer and write mostly choral works, but this is one problem I've come up against again and again. 

How do you or any other composer you know of choose where and how much to abridge texts for vocal works? 

In my mind the most verses one piece should have to be appropriate to set is maybe 5(?) which sadly excludes a huge amount of romantic poetry. 
This is shown to be fairly standard by the observation that even hymns with 6-12 repeated verses only sing through a select 2-5 verses (unless a procession is required).

I have linked 2 poems below, both of which I am considering, one is The Cloud by Shelley and it is a modest example, I think I could use about half of each of the verses given for the work I want to make and likely it would carry some of the original essence of the poetry.

The next example is from Spring, from The Seasons by James Thomson, which is a HUGE work especially if you'd like to include a section for each season and tie it all into one (longer) piece, as I would like to.

I don't see much advice on this that helps other than ""select an appropriate text"" like no shit, but when the words I have already seen and want to use are part of a MUCH larger work what should I do? In terms of naming the piece I would feel odd calling it 'The Seasons after James Thomson' but equally I cannot claim it to be my own work. 

I guess the outcome I'm seeking is:
A. A valid and genuine expression of the text that does not betray the original work.
B. A short enough work to set for choir or for soloist.
C. The strongest parts of a work represented and sung and perhaps repeated, so that audiences don't have to follow along with a page-long program for each work in order to get the important bits.

ym7xao,I am confused now! (Risk on composing),"First of all, if this post is not appropriate for this sub reddit, please let me know. Then I delete it right a way.




Recently I devote myself and my time for the study in a music university. The contents what I am learning is so far so good. I also learn music theory, and computer music, like music which is produced by MAX MSP.


But I do not know why, but for a few months it has become for me harder and harder to compose any kind of music.

I wrote two solo-piano works, 8-9 pages for each of them(so nearly 20 pages altogether), since I had finished the last composition. But I discarded both of them. They are literally suck. Actually I feel that my works are so suck that they are all wortheless.

So I have decided to start from the very basic point again. With very simple harmony, very simple structure, very simple figuration to compose a small solo piece. But I am not sure whether it is good solution or not.

Question : any of you does have the same or at least similar experience? If so, what was your breakthrough?









And second question is a little bit irrelevant from the first one but this issue is also bothering me now : my goal is to become a film composer. I especially love the works of Howard Shore and japanese anime/film composer like Joe Hisaishi, Yoko Kanno.

But what I mainly learn in my music university, is computer music, like MAX MSP or Super Collider. They are interesting and I am recently quite enjoying learning Pure Data. Bit this is not exactly what I tried to learn, in my opinion. You might ask a question like ""then why did you apply to that school""?

Of course we have film music lectures, but not so many. Just two. Quite smaller than what I have expected. 

Therefore I am thinking now what might be the best choice for me: (1) to take double major in Music Theory, by which I can deepen my skills and knowledges on classical music, and that will be good for understanding and digesting and producing the music like Howard Shore or Joe Hisaishi. (2) Or to transfer to another music university which has actual film-scoring department.


PS : I study in Germany. And in Germany, one learns in Music Theory major not only theory but 'style-copy' of classical composers. In Composition major of German music universities one can learn composition but only contemporary music. I do listen contemporary music but not all of them. Minimalism is very interesting for me, but all the minimalists have moved to USA, in my opinion.





So, thank you for reading my post. And how do you think about these matters? How can I overcome my compositoon-crisis and what kind of additional education should I seek?",1667589994.0,Equivalent_Ad_962

yklgcn,What are some good examples of tension and release in composition?,"I attended a workshop with a B-list but brillaint arranger. One of the best examples of tension and release  he gave is Weather Report's ""Birdland"".

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Fm10whccto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fm10whccto)

After the intro, there is a sustained pedal point , with a few brief changes, in the first 26 bars of the verse just before the chorus where it releases  with harmonic  movement ( (""Rhythm changes""\_). After the chorus,  tension is built in the C section  with a 26 bar G pedal point where Zawinul is riffing on the synth bass .Tension is then released by the chromatic descending bass line when Shorter goes to town on his soprano. (The song is also interesting in the way that Zawinul plays some of the bass lines on synth while Jaco swithes from the bass register then  uses harmonics  in the treble  register.) Repeat the intro, build tension with the verse, release again with the chorus and fade.

SInce then, I've found other good examples of tension and release. Any big band shout chorus fits the category. Again, Jaco Pastorious. ' ""Liberty City"" uses both a shout chorus and a pedal point to create tension and release.

In rock, two songs come to mind: Steely Dan's ""The Royal Scam"" and Hall and Oates ""I Can't Go For That"" come to mind.

So i wanted to ask do film composers really work on multiple projects at same time.

Just to brief my question:-  Im talking about a Film Composer who writes Background Score, even does arrangement amd music production and in some projects even do Sound Design like Foley/SFX for the film.

About myself:-

I hv got training from a film school where i completed graduation in the year 2020. Then 2 years went bad bcoz of lockdown. I almost thought of leaving this career multiple times but now i recently worked on a Indian OTT Film which when releases i will put the name here!

So with my experience it was good to finally be able to make living out of music career and it was fun composing and producing for film!

So it took me almost 1 month for background scoring and another month for SFX/sound designing this 100min feature film. Yes it is very much like a upcoming Bollywood OTT film.
I usually do both scoring and sfx for a 20 min reel of film in 2-3 days.

So if i take a webseries then a typical episode of 22-24 min will take me around 2-3 days. Amd 10 episodes will take around 20-25 days.

Now the director wants me take 3-4 such webseries projects. Hence it would mean doing bgm and sfx for 30-40 episodes in 1 month. 
So i wanna ask does it really happen this way? Do usually composers do all this work in just 1 month and are they able to work on multiple projects like this??

The staccato chord progressions is what makes my idea unique from any of my other compositions personally - I really enjoyed making it honestly!

As I mentioned before, the key changes are something I was able to maintain XD - very confusing to smoothly transition from one to another. Using diminished chords, I was able to form some cadences that worked out to my surprise. Everything starts on E major - then gradually the key remains at a happy A Major. Switching to some others, E Major comes back to ultimately sum the calamity of glissandos and dense chords! Haha there's so much going on it's hard to tell anything apart.

NOTE that I compose as a hobby (although as a profession, destined in the future) and my attempts at notations and transcriptions into readable sheet music are of my less abilities. I just like to focus on the sound, and the visuals when put into a video - I tend to worry less about the fact that someone would be up for actually learning such an insane arrangement. As complex as it is though, it would probably look like a black mess anyway. Nonetheless, I have done the deed, but I know there's always something to fix, and that there would be an easier way out to whatever I did haha (I'm 15 for gosh sake!)

Not intended for an actual performance (some sections could be manageable)

Also in some measures I used Voice 2 format for the additional occurrences of added notes since I wanted everything to look as neat as possible. I'm thinking I didn't use the right time signature (plainly just 4/4), so if anyone could tell me the preferred one, that would be great! :D

I'm brand new to reddit, but was told to come here to get in touch with the community more about something I'm creating for the music world!

I'm making a sound library/database of all the acoustic instruments and their extended techniques.  I'm also including detailed information about them such as notation, dynamic and range limits, prep time, and anything else a composer might need to know.  I've got nearly all the traditional orchestral instruments, but as I grow the project, I'm going to include waaaaaay more!  I want to expose the classical music world to instruments and sounds far beyond what is traditionally done.  There's so much room for sound expansion and cultural development that I believe the music community NEEDS.I'm working out of Boston with members of the Silk Road Ensemble as well as local professionals from NEC, Boston Conservatory, and Berklee - all the players being specialists in new music!

I'm reaching out for feedback on my work so far.  I want to know exactly what you - the composers - would like to see!

I'm giving monthly updates of brand new instruments (at least 3 a month, hopefully 5 once I can make more connections).  This is also where I would like to see community get involved as well!  ANYONE who plays a niche instrument or something traditional to their culture would be incredible to have as part of the index!!!

ygjz82,Tips for “modern” flute writing,"I put “modern” in quotes because just because it’s current doesn’t mean you need to feel compelled to write Ferneyhough-level chicken scratch that takes a year to learn and isn’t worth the calories. So, for anyone writing for flute:

Hard for the sake of hard is pretentious. Just because a professional flutist can technically play it doesn’t mean a professional flutist will.

Writing tonal music that is lovely to listen to and fun to play is neither irrelevant nor the sign of an immature composer. Airat Ichmouratov’s Flute Concerto, which is brand-spanking-new, is tricky as hell but super enjoyable and there’s not so much as a multiphonic or spit attack in the whole darn thing.

Be authentic and write what you want. If you use a pirate’s hoard of extended techniques purely because you think that’s what you’re supposed to do, it will be neither a joy to write or perform. Or hear. And it will be obvious to the player.

But, if there are effects you want to go for but don’t know how to notate them, describe them in words as thoroughly as you can and hand them off to a flutist to see what can be done. We love that shit. Hell, send it to me. That’s literally my thing, especially on Reddit.

Speaking of extended techniques:

Spit attacks are cool and easy to do. Same for singing and playing. It’s harder if I have to sing different notes than I'm playing, but it's totally doable and a fun effect.

Fluttertongue is standard. I actually use my throat instead of my tongue because my tone is much clearer this way and I can get all the way down to the lowest note. But this is a me thing -- I'm sure there are plenty of flutists who can accomplish the same with their tongue.

If you're going to write multiphonics (2 or more notes played simultaneously by way of a multitude of alternate fingerings) have a reason for doing so. Do your research, make sure they are actually playable, and provide the fingering in the score. In my opinion this is one of the most overused, overrated, and poorly written effects on the flute. Nevertheless, Ian Clarke's The Great Train Race and Michael Colquhoun's Charanga have excellent examples of this effect, and it's no coincidence that both composers are also flutists.

Most professional flutists have access to a low B, so don't be afraid of this note.

Most importantly: write what you want to hear, not what you think others expect of you. And if you've got something cool you're writing and you're worried it's too hard, write it anyway or else you are liable to talk yourself out of discovering something bad-ass. **Modifying a piece according to what you think is playable is tantamount to saying ""I know more about your instrument than you do.""**",1667050920.0,trevorwatkin

ygboth,Any experts on mensural notation?,"I'm trying to learn to read this stuff and some of the rhythmic conventions (if you can call everyone doing things slightly differently even within the same piece a ""convention"") are tough to get a hold of.  

In particular I've been studying [this well-known piece](https://imgur.com/0r79UwB) by Cordier, and some of the choices I don't quite understand.  I've marked up this document with a few red arrows.  In every case I don't get why these notes were used to indicate the supposed note value.  I would have expected a semibreve in place of the minim for the first arrow (D), a breve in place of the semibreve for the second (D again), and again a semibreve on the third (C#).  I assume it's because these are all notes terminating a ternary group so they just naturally fill out that space, but it still seems an odd choice to specifically use minims when it would have been easier and clearer otherwise.  But then I've noticed ars subtilior composers weren't exactly all about ""clear.""  

And in that regard, I'd like to know why he used color to indicate the proportional change the first time it occurs but then uses ""3"" to denote the exact same proportional change the next two times it occurs.  I assume it has something to do with the fact that he's in prolatorio maior during those sections, but I don't really see why that would matter.

(Tissues are recommended)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqVRcFQagtI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqVRcFQagtI)

   Some background.(If anyone gives a rat’s ass). I began a master's program at one  of the world’s top conservatories for arranging and jazz studies. I did well in the first two semesters of arranging, not so well the third semester when we had to arrange for a jazz ensemble and a whole orchestra.

Then I started attending a class in film scoring just before the advent of computer music applications. We were required to use a calculator and a stopwatch.There is no room for error in this field and your conducting skills must be sharp as a razor.  .The final project of this course was to score a TV show which the school bought the rights to. It was the deep end and I was in over my head. I lasted one week before I switched my concentration to music ed/jazz ed. Some of my classmates, a few of whom I am still in touch with, went on to lucrative and rewarding careers. One of whom did the score to a well known series on Netflix.   

Film scoring is more science than art. They  have many arrows in their slings and the greats know when to use them. The scorers take a deep dive into works of the great composers. If I could sum  up “Baroque” in  one word it would be “fancy”. If I could sum up “Romantic”, it would be “emotional.”. The late Romantic composers especially, were experts at evoking emotions. Think Mahler’s Adagietto from the 5th symphony. It evokes passionate love to  me. Richard  Strauss was a master at telling vivid stories without words with his tone poems. The composers of the twentieth century gave film scorers more tools to evoke terror, chaos and humor. Bartok’s ”Music For Strings, Percussion and Celesta” can unsettle any listener.And  then you have atonality...

  I’ve already been too verbose. I want to know your favorite  film composer and/or film score.  Share with us who, what and why. And if anybody gives a monkey’s, I’ll share mine with all of you.’",1666988155.0,Wintersbone7

I originally intended a piece like this as an opener for a larger work, which would have taken ideas from 17th and 18th century concertos and concerto grossos. I wasn't able to make that idea work very well so I decided to instead focus the ideas I had and make a solid single-movement work. I hope you like it!

    verse -> prechorus 1 -> chorus
    verse -> prechorus 2 -> chorus

The structure for the verses and choruses are the same, the prechoruses have slight variations. My chart looks like:

- verse (**to coda**)

- prechorus 1

- chorus (**D.C. al Coda** *[back to verse]*)

- (**coda**) prechorus 2

- chorus

The verse, prechorus, and chorus sections all have multiple endings, so I don't think it would improve clarity to stick the two prechoruses as endings within a big repeat like this:

    ||: verse -> prechorus [1] [2] -> chorus :||

My other thought was using two different kinds of codas to point to the verse and chorus separately, but I don't know enough to do that.

* Sharing interesting videos and educational content
* Recommending music, soundtracks and more
* Talk about live and unrelated stuff
* Ask questions about all things music and have others explain it to you
* Create study groups and goals
* Create composition / orchestration challanges

I want you to take this serious so you would need at least...

... to be a full time composer (or are working towards it)

...be at most weekly meetings and engage with the server regularly

...writing orchestral music (you can also work with other genres, but your focus should at least partialy be the orchestra)

...be open to both classical styles and film / video game music

it's been a while. I should be busy with my master thesis and the conversion of a soundtrack I'm working on but I had a decent idea for a boss battle theme a few days ago, after getting this one piece from Carmina Burana stuck in my head.

I'm quite a bit proud of the orchestration. Always struggled with that since music university but it has gotten much better in recent years. Also, experimenting with rhythm changes and stuff is always fun, lol.

The render is just Noteperformer in Dorico but I mastered it with Ozone 9 so it should sound ok. As always, Noteperformer does an excellent job at interpreting the music. If only the samples sounded better. That's why I can't wait to get back to my appartment because then I can redo the piece in Cubase with the really good samples.

Until then, enjoy and tell me what you think!

I'd shared a version of this a while ago but some sections have been updated a lot and others have had minor edits and dynamics and articulations changed.

I worked it up in Musescore but took a NotePerformer trial to get a better recording, which worked well in the expressive sections but still sounds a little anaemic at louder dynamics. I’ve heard Musescore 4’s new sound engine and it’s approaching the same expressiveness but maybe still needs a bit of development to get instruments sounding consistent with each other, I didn’t feel it was fair post up that audio yet as it’s still in Beta.

yas4y2,LXI (2021) - A contemporary piece for solo cello,"Hey!

This was the first piece I wrote at Gothenburg University, a school that pushed me to to explore and learn more about contemporary music. 

Our assignment was to write a piece for solo cello that consists of only five notes (which could be used in any octave). In preparation we looked at several pieces, including a piece written for conductor Paul Sacher, where the composer used the notes existing in his surname. I was inspired by this and took a similar approach, but a bit more extensive...

---

As I only had two notes in my name (A and B, from Albin), I decided to do it differently. So I numbered the alphabet where

A = 1 = c

B = 2 = c#

C = 3 = d

D = 4 = d#

etc...

My name of five letters would then give me five notes, although that wasn't quite true. B = 2 = c#, and my last letter N = 13 = c#, giving me the same note twice. My surname's initial is M, which gives the same note as A does, so I decided to take my middle name's initial, J.

This gave me the five letters: A, L, B, I, J, and their corresponding notes: c, b, c#, g#, a. This did however also add more letters, since notes have two or three corresponding letters, giving me a total of twelve letters:

A  B  I  J  L  M  N  U  V  X  Y  Z

The letter's numbers added together becomes 61, written as LXI in roman numerals, the title of the piece. So having arrived with a subset of letters, I decided to write a Swedish poem using only those ones.

From this, I suddenly had the exact order of the notes of the piece. All that was left was the artistic choices of articulation, dynamics, techniques, and so on. 

---

This was quite the process, but it was really fun to try this way of composing. It also made me aware of other ways to convey emotions with music without the freedom of pitch.

The support and enthusiasm for this project means a lot. 435 people have responded with over 700 unique composers in their rankings. The average voter submits a list 11 composers long. 

I am wanting 1000 participants by New Years 2023 (or whichever comes first.) I am almost _halfway_ there thanks to all of you! Trends are no doubt starting to appear as more responses come in.

This is _not_ a poll for ranking which composers are ‘objectively’ best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be warned : The instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. Ranking composers can be tough work.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorites—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it.

   But the hard truth is this: nobody wants to hear your fucking music.A painter or photographer can get people to take a look at their work in 15-30 seconds. Listening to your music takes up peoples time, which they usually don’t have a lot of.
    I had a side gig as a ballet & modern dance musician at a local university. I was officially an “adjunct “ professor “, meaning I was paid a chicken and two bushels of barely. A semester. But I had so much fun at this gig. As a musician, making people dance-even if it’s just one drunk couple in a dive-is one of the most satisfying feeling I’d ever have. Getting young  athletic men and women to move to my music is adrenaline! I had a great relationship with the dance instructor. She was a modern hippy chick who choreographed to a whole melange of genres. She loved what I played in class and encouraged improv and spontaneity. I ad libbed 
A tune one day she said “that’s beautiful! Play it again tomorrow!” I was so encouraged that I started orchestra ting the tune on GB. I spent an entire cross country flight immersed in the project. When i got it where I was somewhat satisfied,I sent the file to that professor telling her I  was under no  expectation for her to choreograph anything to it. (Yeah well, that was BS) She never listened to it. Not once. Even after a few months. I still loved working with her.
    I finally arrived at the “aha moment “ when I gave my headphones to my cousin, who played drums in my band, to tell me what he thought of it. He had them on for maybe 15 seconds, handed them back and patronizingly said “ that’s real good.” So then I said I’m not gonna take it personally this is just the way human nature works. I’m gonna do me and if no one wants to listen to it, including my mama, I’ll keep my day job and keep writing. But it made me realize how so very very difficult it must be to break into any kind of a market of recorded music when really almost no one wants to take the time to hear it no matter how good it may be.

y7o3r5,Writing a two part invention,"
J.S. Bach composed his set of two-part inventions (click here to get a copy of them) as both instructional material for keyboard pedagogy as well as to embody basic contrapuntal principles.

I’ve outlined here a process for composing a simple invention based on Bach’s model.  You will need knowledge of common practice harmony and basic counterpoint to proceed.  Enjoy!


Compose a thematic motive. It should be divisible into two distinct cells (no more–the essence here is simplicity). Bear in mind that later this will be used for sequence, inversion, and other manipulations. It should have strong harmonic implication.  Write this out in the upper part in the first measure.

Write an answer to that theme in the lower voice in the tonic key.   It’s generally best for the answer to be an octave lower than the upper part.

Compose a counterpoint above the answer in the first voice. This is called the countertheme and it will make several more appearances. The relationship between the two voices should be double counterpoint.

Continue on in the upper part with the theme, but this time it should be on the dominant.

Under this dominant presentation, the lower voice presents the countertheme (can be slightly varied).  Follow this with the theme on the dominant.

At this point, you will begin planning out sequences (two or three) that will set up a modulation to V (III if you started in a minor key).

Begin the sequence with fragments of the theme in the upper part, then the lower part. When you get close to the cadence point (where the modulation will be realized), you may further fragment the theme.

The counterpoint to the theme during this series of sequences should be derived from the countertheme.

The cadence itself may be written with some freedom in order to give a sense of arrival.

This concludes the exposition of the invention.

Since you are now in the key of the dominant (or III), you will begin with the theme in this key, though unlike the exposition, you will begin with the theme in the lower part.  This second portion of the invention proceeds much as the first, though the sequences will proceed to a new related key (vi, ii, ii, or IV if in major, v VI, or iv if in minor).

The final section usually starts out with sequences, with the theme alternating between the parts.  The final cadence is sometimes delayed by deceptive sequences.

This process results in a simple invention based on Bach’s first invention.  Study the others closely to note other ways of composing these intriguing little works!",1666140354.0,FrenchAugmentedSixth
y7j1re,Can you play a perfect fourth on a natural horn/trumpet?,"Just trying to understand how this works. 

I've read that the natural horn/trumpet can only play notes from its overtone series, which in C would be C, C, G, C, E, G and so on and so on. 

So, in the key of C, we simply could not play a perfect fourth interval if we were playing with two natural trumpets for example? We couldn't play a C on one of them and an F on another? Further more, we couldn't play a melody on a natural trumpet that goes C - F - C - F - C?

y6dzh6,How do composers that can't read sheet music notate their music?,"Thought that just recently crossed my mind. For me the process is kinda reversed. I come in with ideas and complete 80-90% digitally and engraving may be complicated, but it's not a big issue for me, because obviously I can read what I'm doing. It simply takes time, for example something I've been working on recently is technically complete to share, but the engraving process is taking extra time for me (simply because I'm messy and inexperienced).

Now that is my perspective. Consider you sit down next to a piano and start composing (so you don't work digitally), but you also don't read notes (as some of the best artists of our time do). Do you type out the letters on a sheet of paper? Do you just record and play by ear? Or do you have to sit down with a DAW after finishing your session to sort of save your process. The thought popped into my head, because my entire process is so heavily reliant on sheet music that I can't really imagine how it would work without it.",1666020383.0,DaGuys470

y5tcyt,Block-Harm Rhapsody (2021) - A jazz big band piece,"Hey!

Block-Harm Rhapsody was originally written as a small assignment for a music theory course, specifically about block harmonization. However I liked the piece so much that I expanded on it to a fully fledged piece. I like the way this piece moves between different genres and atmospheres quite haphazardly, which is also the cornerstone of the Rhapsody as a musical form.

---

Firstly it establishes the main theme, then moves on to more of a laid back swing, coming back to a slightly more rigid theme variant, moving on to a kind of Mario Kart-esque vibe, building up to a heavy metal breakdown, and finally collapsing over itself in a third, more drunken variation of the theme. Quite the ride!

The main theme is heavily reliant on the shifting odd time signature groove:

7/8 + 9/8 + 7/8 + 4/4

Subdivided as follows:

3+2+2 --- 3+2+2+2 --- 3+2+2 --- 2+2+2+2

As it turns out, though not unexpected, this was more difficult to play than I had anticipated... However as a student it's all part of the process. The rest of the piece however is a bit more straight forward.

---

The piece was written in the Spring of '21, then polished over the next year and [performed by Gothenburg Jazz Orchestra 6th of June '22.](https://youtu.be/G_79qUqDZe0?t=74) I wish we had a bit more time to rehearse, but hopefully I'll get the chance for it to be played again in the future!

Hi, While I have been playing music all my life I have finally started dipping my toes into writing original music for our band and i have no idea what I'm doing really. The band is built of a Singer, Trumpet, Trombone (that's me), Electric guitar, Electric base guitar and Drums.

What I have mainly focused on in this score, and want critiqued is song structure, chord progression, trumpet-trombone melody and base line. The drum beat and guitar is very rudimentary and there only to anchor the rest. Song melody or lyrics is not included.

What I'm most uncertain about is:

* The song structure which to me feels like five separate ideas slapped together and I'm uncertain if the really fit well together.
* The intro melody does not feel groovy at all (Too basic? To happy? Annoying?)

However I appreciate any and all constructive comments, brutal honesty is welcome. Thanks!

For ease of reference the song pars are: 

[I]ntro melody (8 bars), Part A (8 bars), Part B (8 bars), Part C (8 bars), Part D (11 bars), [O]utro Melody (11 bars)

The song structure is: I, A, B, C, I, A ,B, C, D, O",1665901035.0,Smussi

&#x200B;

Edit: just to add, because some people are introducing strawmen logical fallacies into the discussion. My point is that voice does not have to be gendered. That's it. And I'm sharing my process with you. I'm not stating which voice types are gendered and which aren't, so it doesn't matter whether it's SATB or any sub category of those. Some of you are coming back with 'but women can sing bass; men can sing soprano' (this is confusing pitch and timbre: I'm not talking about vocal ranges. I'm talking about how vocal timbres are inextricably linked to gender).  I'm also talking about tradition vs today. Please note my use of the word 'traditional'. My point is that voice is not inherently gendered today (the world of trans opera singers demonstrates this), but traditional classifications ARE based on gender. This isn't news. I'm not claiming anything new here and this aspect is not my research. This point is common knowledge in opera and is in all the relevant literature. My research is in rethinking traditional opera and working with trans voices.

And I DO know what I'm talking about. I sang in a children's choir on TV and radio, then cathedral choir on TV and radio for years, I have a PhD in contemporary classical composition, I have my grade 8 in classical voice from Trinity, I am a qualified lecturer (AFHEA) and I discuss all this research in depth on my YouTube channel where I talk about the process of composing this opera and also my research into traditional voice categories (explored in relation to perspectives today).",1665856164.0,Alannah_from_YouTube

I want to give a huge shoutout to [Kymatic](http://kymatic.space/eng/) for performing my piece Codex Praxis at the Sensor Festival in Armenia. It's rare and very special for a piece of this scale to get put on out in the world, and I'm extremely honored and thankful to have had this out there and to have it so thoughtfully and artistically explored. 

With this piece, I wanted to take ideas from medieval and renaissance music, liturgical drama, etc. and map it onto my own aesthetic. There is still drama in the work, but much more abstract. In a way, I wanted this piece to be something of a ""found document.""

I hope me asking this can help others frame their approach to/experiences with potentially similar situations (I was unable to find a preexisting post that talks about this specific thing).

Some context, in short: I recently landed my first video game gig and it's been going really great after a solid few months. The team is really small, everyone's super cool, and I love everything about the concept and characters. Contract has been signed, nothing fishy or felt unfair, but I realized some weeks in that it made no mention of an original soundtrack or how that would look if one was planned.

From my understanding (which may be incorrect as I'm still new to this), game audio composers generally don't collect traditional publisher/master royalties from the games they work on, but could if an OST for the game is created (due to streams/purchases/etc.)

That said, for those of you who have created music/audio for games which put out an OST, what were your experiences in navigation? Were there agreements or compromises appended to your preexisting contract? Did you keep all/partial rights? Did you initiate the idea of releasing the OST? Whatever you'd like to share on the topic.

Sixteen minutes, the journey's been worth it. Originally I was planning on writing four concertos, around 10 minutes each (imagine). This alone is over 40 now, I feel this is quite enough for the seasonals this year. I've got a fine ship to pilot now, gold and crimson in color - it's time to find a crew… to set sail. This is what I realized.

I decided to break this up into five passages to help follow the score (post-composition):

I. Exposition and subject introduction: strings -> piano -> + brass -> flute, timpani & winds -> strings and trio (1-128)

II. Development: mainly strings and trio (129-266)

III. Trio I: orchestra -> violin solo I -> duo I -> trio I (267-460)

IV. Trio II: orchestra -> trio -> violin solo II -> duo II -> trio II (461-642)

V. Recapitulation and finale: strings -> orchestra -> piano solo & finale (643-849)

Violin solo I starts at 5:41 (312)

Violin solo II starts at 9:53 (529)

Hey, this is my 1st real(meaning the score is 100% my work, maybe save for the first couple of measures if you count quoting the very beginning of Dimitri's work) composition, no external help or even looking things up on the web and I'm very proud of it. I don't really know much about music theory besides the very fundamental stuff like the minor&major scales, chords, and a very basic understanding of harmony, so I just went with the good old ""if I like it and it sounds reasonably good, it stays"" approach.

xxdzqz,"""Stream"" for clarinet in Bb & live electronics","Here's a small solo piece for clarinet & live electronics I composed this summer. The piece alternates between fast passages and long, sustained pitches. The electronics in this piece is a simple reverb patch I created in pure data, which is controlled by a sustain pedal by the player. Similar effect could be created with any commercial vst or a hardware pedal but I decided to create it in pd because it's free and hence accessible for anyone. The reverb pedal adds sustain to certain pitches mainly on the cadential passages of the piece. The name of the piece comes from an allusion of a stream of something I had when composing this piece. When the reverb patch is switched on, I felt the 'stream' was spilling over. I hope you like it!

Organized by Access Contemporary Music, Spudnik Press, and Homeroom Chicago, we were tasked to create art based on the idea words of ""cold"", ""cool"", ""blue"", and ""green"".  

We were inspired by the weather in Chicago at that time in the spring of 2013, the slow dripping of melting ice, and the feeling of waking up again after hibernation. 

Back in 2013 when I wrote this, I was really pushing myself to compose ""outside of my box"" because I felt like a lot of my music was sounding the same (as naturally happens when finding one's voice). While I don't love that I used certain beaming styles of Finale 😆, I am particularly pleased with the textures that I wrote. I would definitely notate things a little differently 10 years later, but all in, it's a piece I'm happy with.

xw1pk2,Shout out to Margaret Brouwer,"Some time ago the Logan HS Winterguard used Margaret Brouwer's Sonata for Horn and Piano for their show (I think 2005?) and, before I knew what the piece was called, I thought it was just some dreamy piece for horn and really loved it. And I really wanted to play it. But I'm a flutist.

So, two summers ago I finally emailed her and said, essentially, ""I love this piece and I really wish it was written for flute. Would you be cool with me arranging it and performing it?"" which I felt a little weird about doing because it's such a personal piece for her, and quite a famous one. And, in all fairness, her initial response was ""Well...OK, but it's a horn piece. So. Um?"" but she relented. And to my relief she actually was happy with the test recordings I sent over from rehearsal.

I'm saying all this because this was a seriously bad-ass, generous thing for an established composer for her to do for someone she didn't even know, and certainly didn't need to do at all even if the piece weren't as famous as it actually is. And I want everyone to know about it. In fact, my next recital of other, similarly bad-ass music for flute and piano (on which this piece features heavily) is literally entitled ""One of These Pieces Was Written for Horn but Margaret Brouwer Let Me Arrange It for Flute Because She's a Boss.""

xuzy3g,Three Poems for Voice and Piano Quartet,"Original text, all words and music are my own. First drafts for just piano and voice completed October 2021. Full score and parts finished in late March 2022. As I say in my composer note, the original idea was an art song as requested by the singer, but the piece I wrote first (""Unique"") turned out really musical theater-y, and I realized it would work better as the end of a short song cycle. All three are in different styles, with harmonic language and phrase structure varying greatly. Even the texts are varied--the first is very through composed, with no rhyme scheme; the second is quite square, with a sort of arch form that grows in the middle and comes back down; and the third has really snappy trick rhymes with varied rhythms. As you might be able to tell from this, I ended up spending more time on the text and text-setting than the music--it was so satisfying for me the way it all came together. My interpreter was spectacular as well--I had a really clear idea of what I wanted and we spent a lot of time in rehearsal discussing the various characters and ideas.

I. Alarmed - A character who seems tormented by her alarm clocks (represented in the accompaniment) may actually be dealing with some deeper anxieties.  
II. Wallflower - A painfully shy individual dreams of opening up to others.  
III. Unique - An egomaniac gives us a horrifying and oblivious glimpse into what it's like to be truly one-of-a-kind.

Really, all of these songs are just about connecting, and show characters who struggle to do so or feel misunderstood, or are fighting themselves in their own way. I hope you enjoy and I hope you recognize yourself in some way.

My big brag on this piece is that Lori Laitman, who is such a prolific art song composer that her website is literally [artsongs.com](https://artsongs.com), loved them and gave me positive feedback on the score and performance.

xtp7dl,Learning to imitate a certain piece?,"Hello,

I am trying a new technique (reinforcement learning) which tries to teach to the computer how to play ""For Elise"" the left hand. The computer learns by playing games, so to say: Each game consists of the computer playing some note (pitch, duration, volume, isrest). If it plays the next expected note of ""For Elise"", then it gets say +1 point. If it hits a note which sound similar but not the expected one, then it gets -1 points. It tries to maximize the expected reward. It can learn the first few notes very quickly ( after a few minutes, but then somehow it gets stuck.)

Here is what it has learned after 1840 games and random initialization:

Pdf: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1\_peTMEAcNhRoWTwpKhlp1AduTcEkLkqk/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_peTMEAcNhRoWTwpKhlp1AduTcEkLkqk/view?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

The internal view is, that it sees the last four notes played and after playing three consecutive wrong notes it is game over.

My naive question for composers is this:

I am not trying to literally let the computer learn the piece, as this would be somehow boring at the end.

What I am trying to do, is to learn to play in a similar sound as the original piece.

So my very naive question is this: Suppose you would teach a novice composer to learn to imitate a given piece of music. How would you do that? What would be the right ""reward"" for this? (If this question makes any sense... as I can understand that it is very naive and open ended)

So, I've reviewed the FAQ: ""music in non-classical styles or at least in styles that branch from classical styles is more than welcome if accompanied by a score."" But I still have some imposter syndrome here given the amazing, fully orchestrated work others are posting. It's hopefully a painless 1:22 of your time.

I'm working in a musical theater program, auditioning for composer. The song is inspired by the movie *The Big Sick.* The concept is based on the protagonist (a budding standup comedian) struggling on stage as he contemplates the gravity of his loved one's illness. 

I'm deliberately trying for an early 1960s movie soundtrack style, ala Henry Mancini. 

Some questions: 

\- Do you think the melody is poignant and suitable to the intent? 

\- Are the modulations and other chromaticism too much? Too little? (The modulation framework is lifted from Carole King's song Tapestry)

\- In terms of arrangement: the requested instrumentation is oboe over piano. But this will be sung by a baritone. I am wondering if I should flip the piano accompaniment staffs, so eighth notes RH, chords LH. (Obvously need to re-voice the chords more openly if LH). 

\- Playability: I am by training a guitarist with very basic ""arrangers piano"" skills. Is the accompaniment playable? Seems like the LH would be a workout. Also I think the pedaling gets a little muddy. 

\- Overall: Is this professional quality work,  ready for prime time? Obviously subjective, but let me have your thoughts. I have a pretty thick skin, the composing faculty have been making me do a lot of rewrites :-)

I definitely want to make some edits to it, but that’s after working on something else for a few months. 

This piece comes after making the mistake of starting my composition journey with film scoring, which led to some issues with learning how to properly structure and conceptualize a piece. I decided to start with a very simple concept, which was characterizing the woodwinds as the “good guys” and the brass as the “bad guys”. The brass would periodically part the veil from behind the woodwinds, eventually blowing away the facade completely. 

Although this piece is done, I’d love to get some advice on how to improve for future pieces! Thanks for listening!

As inspiration comes and goes I’ve been writing different sections on different days and ultimately tried to tidy it up. My last large work I wrote the movements individually then merged them after. Wondering if I should have done the same thing here…

Essentially my problem is I did a system break and page break before going back to an unfinished movement. As I’ve written more it’s encroached on the next movement and I’ve caused a bit of a mess. I broke the page and placed the next movement on a fresh page but am now left with two split systems and I can’t seem to merge them. Any advice would be appreciated.

xqqo1f,Seeking composer for a D&D actual play podcast theme,"Hello r/composer! I am looking for someone who can help me out with a podcast theme.

The game is set in Eberron - for those unfamiliar, we have described it as fantasy meets pulp meets noir. Magic is widely available, with most people knowing at least a cantrip or two, but rarely are people able to cast over fifth level spells. Set on the continent of Khorvaire, the game will follow a party of three as they navigate adolesence, grief, politics, and conspiracy in a rapidly developing world.

The game is set four years after The Mourning - a cataclysmic event that blanketed a whole country in a layer of mist and brought forth unspeakable horrors to the land - at the culmination of a war lasting over 100 years. The war ended not at a peaceful resolution, but out of fear - with the warring nations afraid they would be next, a ceasefire was called, and the continent is in an unstable peacetime. Halfings ride dinosaurs in the plains of the east, while demon tribes and ancient evils dominate the lands of the west.

Our thoughts on the music are as follows; we would like elements of general fantasy themes, but would also love heavier inspiration from swing and jazz music styles. The piece should be up to 45 seconds long, ideally with a solid introduction befitting a podcast.

We thought that it could start with a sweeping fantasy opening, and after a few seconds, cut to a more modern, swing/jazz style while maintaining a consistent melody/motif throughout. It would be used both as an introduction and end piece, playing at either end of an episode.

You will receive full payment, full credition, and may retain the rights to the music. As we are a small group at the moment, we would not be able to offer royalties, but we are willing to negotiate commercial licensing.

I look forward to hearing from you - if possible, please provide a link to your portfolio, and feel free to ask any questions! I would appreciate a price guideline in the comments if at all possible, but I understand if you would prefer to save price discussion for DMs.

xpxsr2,Trying to write music in other ways,"Sometimes I like to improvise in pentatonic, since it is very easy to make a pleasent sound. When taking what I got and writing down, there are a lot of notes in the clef that I don't use, so I decided to make my own notation for pentatonic. It's similar to conventional clef notation, but there is no space for ""white"" notes (piano thing).

Then I realised I could go even further. I could set up every note I wanted in this way, I just would need a way of saying what notes would be. So the ""clef"" starts with a bar without measure with the first note meaning the place it ""starts"" and the other notes meaning what notes are in there. All the notes are quarter notes without the | (just the •).

I know it's totally outside the usual and traditional music writing, but for personal use it's pretty useful.

xn3ixv,Exploring scales that aren't diatonic,"Recently, when I was studying some Bach (at the piano) I found an interesting sequence of notes that really doesn't fit in major or minor scales.
It was basically a C major but with 3rd (E) minor. The piece was fugue no.2 from Well Tempered.
After that, I took some Mozart inspiration to compose and the Symphony 25 (I guess) have a Bb A G F# sequence. When I transposed it from G (minor) to C I got the same scale: major 3rd minor.
Also I tried to ""flat"" the 6th degree and finally the 7th, giving the minor scale.
All this gave me inspirations to study more about these unusual scales (at least for me), but I found almost no information.
Church modes and pentatonic ""fit"" in diatonic scale, so they are not really different stuff.
Also, I tried C E F# G# A B and C D# E F G Ab Bbb, but these kinda sounded wierd.

The average voter submits a list 12 composers long. I will not say which two, but the top two composers are very close to being tied so far.

I am wanting 1000 participants by New Years 2023 ( or whichever comes first). I am one third there thanks to all of you! Trends are no doubt starting to appear as more responses come in.

This is _not_ a poll for ranking which classical composers are objectively best, only a compilation of lists from you all! This was requested by a few DMs as well as a few on this page. Be Warned : The instructions are lengthy and the rules are specific so if you have the time I would appreciate it if you all could take some time to fill it out. You are able to edit your responses up until the 31st of December if you wish to.

I am very happy this format of individually typing out composers—where each participant ranks their own favorite—has yielded such incredibly diverse responses. That’s a lot of data but they will bring forth some very interesting results. As there is no database on the internet of every single composer, I figured I would leave it to you all to supply who you would rank among your favorites, this has worked very well! There will be two methods of ranking as explained in the description of the poll within the link above. Share it around if you know anyone who may like it.

xlvs5s,Piano composers expected to be performers as well,"What’s the community view on the perception I have of the classical music world’s expectation that composers of piano music should also be the performers of said music?

To illustrate; I have several albums of music by composers such as Chas Lawson, Dustin O’Halloran, Ludovico Einaudi, Rachel Grimes, Oskar Schuster, Nils Frahm, et al. and I don’t think I’ve a single recording of even one of their works played by any other than themselves. Meanwhile, I’ve got recordings made by Lang Lang, Daniel Barenboim, Vanessa Benelli Mosell, Martha Argerich, et al. and none of them play music they’ve written, if any of them have ever written anything at all. 

I look through my own recording library of classical music and I can see a trend. Composers of most any other type of music are left to be composers and little more; living composers of piano solo works are usually the sole performers of their work. It seems you can be a professional composer of orchestral music, choral music, chamber music, and ensemble music amongst other forms, and remain behind the page, focused entirely on the writing of said music. But if you compose for a pianist *you* are the pianist. 

The reason this rubs me the wrong way is pretty simple; I’m not a performer. I did a music degree and ditched performance after it became optional in my second year. I hated doing it in first year so I wasn’t going to carry it. I focused my studies mostly on theory, history, and of course composition. I am comfortable playing my own music for myself and others who happen to hear me at home. I’ve been known to sit down at a public piano once or twice too, granted. But I believe to be a true performer, I would need to dedicate a great number of hours and days, months and years to honing my craft. But I already did and continue to do that; as a composer. If you want to hear one of my pieces played with the odd wrong note here or there fine, I’ll play it. But you’d want your money back on that CD/recording wouldn’t you.

I also believe that the performer has equal value to the realisation of a piece as the composer themselves. I wrote it and I know what it wanted to say; now I want to hear what you think it says and then hear it say it. Think about how different different performers’ performances of the same pieces can sound. The phrasing, tempi, colourisation, lightness of touch, everything can be subtly influential to the final realisation of a piece. And I want to hear that. I want to sit in the audience and be as mesmerised as they are. 

As a final point (complaint?), do we not feel that by expecting composers of piano solo to be their own performers, we’re creating an unnecessary barrier to having certain composers’ music getting beyond the page or their own piano? I certainly feel like it’s a barrier of mine.

Ultralocrian scale is 1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 bb7

I was trying a some weird scale

This is B Ultralocrian (have B C D Eb F G Ab)

For key signature idk what better key signature with 3 flats or 2 sharps

(3 flats would use from relative minor key (accidential is B natural)

2 sharps was use from parallel minor key (accidential is F natural, C natural, Eb, Ab))

but i think i stick with 3 flats because it use less accidential)

I also try finding good sf2/sfz guitar and bass but I 
can't find it. (May be I will try import midi file to FLStudio?)

xihdw4,_sidestory (Flute and Electronics),"Hi, I'm a senior highschooler aspiring to be a composer in the future. I'll be applying for music school in a few months. Anyway that doesn't matter. I just wanted to share some music. 

I believe it's one of the few pieces I am actually happy with. I experimented very boldly on this one. I had never used electronics before so it was my first time programming Pure Data. It was also the first time using a Lachenmann inspired ideas for a full length piece. And most importantly, it was the first time I actually wrote about my life events.

If you listen carefully, the fixed media is from the 1999 Columbine Massacre. I wasn't there. I wasn't even born yet. However, gradually learning about the massacre, I learned a few lessons that really resonated with me. And so, I decided to write about it. I try to make the piece as non-political as possible as I don't mean to comment on the incident itself. I have opinions. However, I only use the incident as a means of expression.

If anyone reads the performance notes, I do apologize. I tried my best to make it clear and concise... It's more difficult than it looks.

I'm welcome to any feedback, especially from experienced composers. I want to see how you guys tear down my favourite piece. For myself, I believe I lack a personal voice. The music sounds a bit generic to me. However, I didn't have time to fix that.

Links are on the bottom. I won't give out the electronic files as I'm a bit afraid of someone stealing them. However, if you DM me, I can send them to you. Thanks in advance for anyone who chooses to give me feedback. Have a nice day!

xi92zx,First Light - The first track from my upcoming album,"Hello everyone!  


I wanted to jump on and share the first piece from my recently recorded album, 'This Too Shall Pass'. The album was originally released in 2019, with the intent of expressing my experiences living with Bipolar Disorder and undergoing electroconvulsive therapy in hospital. The original album was released using sample library mockups. Since the original release I have had 3 further courses of ECT, and several months ago ran a Kickstarter to raise the funds to record an updated version of the album with a live orchestra. The recording session happened just over a month ago, but I have unfortunately been back in hospital for another course of treatment. The good news is I have managed to get one of the tracks together for release, and wanted to share it with you all. 

This piece, titled First Light, was written for a very specific moment of my original treatment. I had been in a severely deep depression (to the point of making an attempt on my life), and the ECT was a last resort for me. The morning of my 5th treatment, I came to and went outside to have my morning coffee - and I felt sunlight for the first time in months. I do not know if you have ever experienced a deep depression but even things like feeling the warmth of the sun can be lost. So this moment was a truly massive breakthrough in my treatment, and became the basis of this piece.

I have linked both the score and video of the recording session below, and I do hope you enjoy it. I am sorry for making you read so much as well!

Hello folks!

I just finished my latest composition and wanted to share it with you.  
After several months of writer's block, I finally managed to compose something I'm happy with again (:  
I've been following this subreddit for 1 year now and wanted to contribute something as well....

Brief info about me: m(17), piano for 10 years and composing for 2 years.

About the piece itself: It was the 1st piece I composed 100% on the computer. So my writing process was also quite different, which I actually found quite refreshing. While accidentally playing the A theme backwards, I noticed that it sounds relatively baroque, which inspired me to write the B theme (basically the A theme, but backwards).

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to making a proper recording of the piece yet. But I hope that the MIDI file can give you a rough feeling of the piece (:

I wish you a lot of fun with it and I'm looking forward to any kind of criticism!

Over several months me and a violist met every other week, I brought my ideas and we got to go through the composition process together. It was really fun and educational being able to workshop your ideas while in the middle of the process, as well as letting the musician be a part of it from the beginning!

I found it difficult to write for only the viola because of the style of music I aspire to create, so I cheated a bit and decided to play the piano along with him... But I think the result was quite beautiful!
