We remove any duplicate posts from these data sets, and we fill \"missing\" body text with the empty string (since it appears that these body texts are not eactually missing, but intentionally empty).  We also make sure that there are no other obvious issues with the data, such as missing post titles or incorrect data types.  We then export the cleaned data sets."

I find it very satisfying and helpful to my process to constantly finish little things in between my larger projects- it helps me stay organized and keep composing.\\nStay tuned as I'll be releasing one little miniature recording a week on youtube for the next few months!\\nThis first installment is called \"Madrigal\" after the old italian vocal tradition. It's a tender little thing that I think is appropriate for this time of year! It's dedicated to my old composition teacher at Peabody, Michael Hersch, and is a sort of hommage to some of his music.\\nHope y'all enjoy!\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/DSJukDcSRsQ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

Overall, the Soundtrack is a mix between a modern classical approach, destructing the rules andcolors of an orchestra, and integrating as well African colors.**\\n\\nPlease find here a link towards several Streaming platforms, and below one of the music sheetDon't hesitate to have a look at my Website, and follow me on Instagram for more content.

       "Guy wants a song that is entirely acapella.\\n\\nI guess his first idea was to just do multiple takes of himself singing, harmonising with himself.\\n\\nAlthough we're probably gonna try this idea too, my advice was for him to do a proper recording of an actual acapella crew. 5 people singing simultaneously, each with a close mic and also a stereo pair in the room to make it more a natural and interesting version of the song.\\n\\nIf he's up for hiring some professional singers it's no big deal since we're bound to get a decent take sooner or later.\\nHowever, we're trying to budget the whole thing and the best thing would be to have a few friends sing, musicians that do have the ability to sing but are not professional, so pitch could be an issue. He himself is not the best singer, kind of off pitch and not the cleanest voice, especially on higher registers.\\n\\nIs it possible for me to eventually pitch correct the stereo/room recording? Close mics won't be too much of an issue.      1\n",
